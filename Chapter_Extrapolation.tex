\chapter{Extrapolation}

	As we have seen in the introduction, the Harmonic Oscillator (HO) basis is
	routinely used in Low-energy Nuclear Physics (LENP) calculations.  We also saw
	that
	the size of Hamiltonian matrix that we need to diagonalize grows factorially
	with the number of nucleons, severely restricting the number of terms that
	can be kept in the basis expansion.  The maximum number of terms in the basis
	expansion is often denoted by $\Nmax$, so the single particle nuclear wave
	function is given by
	\beq
	\psi_{N_{\rm max}}^{\Omega}(r) = \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{N_{\rm max}} c_{\alpha}
	\phi_{\alpha}^{\Omega}(r) \;.
	\label{eq:single_particle_truncation}
	\eeq
	$\phi_{\alpha}^{\Omega}(r)$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:single_particle_truncation} are
	the HO wave functions; $\Omega$ is the frequency of the HO \footnote{
	In LENP, the oscillator frequency is often denoted by $\Omega$ rather
	than $\omega$.}.
	Thus the energy obtained in the HO basis -- $E(\Nmax, \Omega)$ -- is a
	function of $\Nmax$ and $\Omega$.  This is illustrated in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:H6_function_Omega}.

	We see that as we go to higher $\Nmax$, the curves get flatter with respect
	to $\Omega$, or in other words the dependence on $\Omega$ drops out.

	The goal is to extrapolate to $\Nmax = \infty$ from a finite $\Nmax$.
	The most widely used extrapolation scheme employs an exponential in $\Nmax$
	form
	\beq
	E(\Nmax) = \Einf + a e^{-c \Nmax}\;,
	\label{eq:exp_Nmax_extrapolation}
	\eeq
	where $a$ and $c$ are determined separately for each $\hw$ (with the
	option of constraining the fit to get the same asymptotic $\Einf$ value).
	Figure~\ref{fig:exp_Nmax_extrapolation_6He} shows estimate for the ground
	state energy for $^6$He obtained using the extrapolation form of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:exp_Nmax_extrapolation}.

	The exponential in $\Nmax$ extrapolation is widely used in literature and
	seems to work quite well
	\cite{Hagen:2007hi,Bogner:2007rx,Forssen:2008qp,Maris:2008ax,Roth:2009cw}.
	There are however many open questions about this extrapolation scheme such as
	the answer for $\Einf$ depends on the oscillator frequency $\Omega$ and it is
	not clear which the best choice for $\Omega$.  The terms $a$ and $c$ in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:exp_Nmax_extrapolation} are fit to data.  There is no way to
	extract these terms for one nucleus and use it to predict something else.
	Moreover, the physical motivation for exponential in $\Nmax$ extrapolation is
	slim at best.  It has been claimed that for larger nuclei $\Nmax$ is a
	logarithmic measure of the number of states \cite{Bogner:2007rx}.

	An alternative approach to extrapolations is motivated by effective field
	theory (EFT) and based instead on explicitly considering the infrared (IR)
	and ultraviolet (UV) cutoffs imposed by a finite oscillator
	basis~\cite{Coon:2012ab}.  The truncation in the oscillator basis introduces
	a maximum length scale (or an IR cutoff) and also a maximum momentum scale
	(or an UV cutoff).  These length and momentum scales can be motivated by
	the classical turning points denoted by $L_0$ and $\Lambda_0$ respectively.
	We have
	\begin{align}
	L_0 = \sqrt{2 (\Nmax + 3/2)} b \;, \nonumber \\
	\Lambda_0 = \sqrt{2 (\Nmax + 3/2)} \hbar/b \;.
	\label{eq: L0_Lam0_cutoff}
	\end{align}
	$b$ is the oscillator length given by
	$\displaystyle b = \sqrt{\hbar/ m \Omega}$.
	%
	The errors due the finite IR (UV) cutoff are called the IR (UV) errors.
	To draw a lattice analogy, IR errors stem from the finite box size,
	and the UV errors are a result of the finite lattice spacing (or the
	graininess of the lattice).  Ideally, we would like the box size to be as
	large as possible and the lattice spacing to be as small as possible.
	Because of finite computational power, this is not always possible though
	and therefore we need reliable extrapolation schemes in both IR as well as UV.

	This approach of thinking of the HO truncation in terms of IR and UV cutoffs
	has led to lot of development in past three years.
	We can choose the oscillator parameters such that one of the cutoffs in
	Eqs.~\eqref{eq: L0_Lam0_cutoff} is large, making the errors due to that cutoff
	small and focus on the errors due to the other cutoff.
	The first attempt and
	test for a theoretically motivated IR correction was made in
	\cite{Furnstahl2012}.  These corrections were made theoretically sound
	in \cite{More:2013rma, Furnstahl:2013vda}.  In \cite{Konig:2014hma} we looked
	at the UV correction for the deuteron.
	Our papers \cite{More:2013rma, Furnstahl:2013vda, Konig:2014hma} have led to
	physically motivated extrapolation schemes and will form the basis of the next
	two sections.  Insights from our work has also led to development of
	extrapolation schemes (both in IR and UV) for the many-body case by other
	groups.  We will touch upon these developments in
	Sec.~\ref{sec:related_development_IR}.

	\section[Infrared story]{Infrared story
	\footnote{Based on \cite{More:2013rma} and \cite{Furnstahl:2013vda}}}
	\label{sec:IR_story}

	As mentioned in the introduction, there was a lack of well motivated
	extrapolation schemes in LENP and this is where our work comes in.
	We started with the two-body case because it is more tractable
	mathematically.  Note that extrapolation is usually not necessary for the
	two-body problem, because the convergence is reached before we run out of
	computational power.  This allows us to test our extrapolation formulas.
	Once we establish that the approach works for the two-body case, we can hope
	to extend the approach to few- and many-body case.

	As mentioned earlier, IR cutoff effectively puts system in a finite box.
	We need to find appropriate box length such that
	\beq
	E(\Nmax) = E(L_{\rm box})\;.
	\label{eq:Nmax_Lbox_correspondence}
	\eeq
	Note that our original problem was to find $\Einf \equiv E(\Nmax = \infty)$
	given $E$ at a finite $\Nmax$.  Once we make the correspondence in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:Nmax_Lbox_correspondence} and express energy as a function of
	box length, we can use various techniques (discussed later) to estimate
	$E (L_{\rm box} = \infty)$ which equals $E(\Nmax = \infty)$.

	\subsection{Tale of tails}
	\label{subsec:tale_of_tails}

	The box size is usually bigger than the range of the potential.  Thus
	imposing the IR cutoff modifies the asymptotic part (or tail) of the
	bound-state wave function.  Our early work focused on trying to estimate the
	appropriate box size by matching the tails of wave functions in the truncated
	HO basis to the tails of wave functions in boxes of different lengths.

	Our strategy was to use a range of model potentials for which the
	Schr\"odinger equation can be solved
	analytically or to any desired precision numerically to broadly test
	and illustrate various features, and then turn to the deuteron for a
	real-world example.  In particular we considered:
	%
	\bea
	V_{\rm sw}(r) &=& -V_0\, \theta(R-r)   \qquad \mbox{[square well]}
	\;,
	\label{eq:Vsw}
	\\
	V_{\rm exp}(r) &=& -V_0\, e^{-(r/R)}  \qquad\ \ \mbox{[exponential]}
	\;,
	\\
	V_{\rm g}(r) &=& -V_0\, e^{-(r/R)^2}  \qquad\ \mbox{[Gaussian]}
	\;,
	\label{eq:Vg}
	\\
	V_{\rm q}(r) &=& -V_0\, e^{-(r/R)^4} \qquad\ \mbox{[quartic]}
	\;,
	\label{eq:Vq}
	\eea
  %
	where for each of the models we work in units with $\hbar = 1$, reduced mass
	$\mu=1$, and $R=1$, but consider different values for $V_0$.  For the
	realistic potential we use the Entem-Machleidt 500\,MeV chiral EFT
	N$^3$LO potential~\cite{Entem:2003ft} and unitarily evolve it with the
	similarity renormalization group (SRG).  These potentials provide a
	diverse set of tests for universal properties.  Because we can go to
	very high \hw\ and $\Nmax$ for the two-particle bound states (and
	therefore large $\LamUV$), it is possible to always ensure that UV
	corrections are negligible.

	We start with empirical considerations before presenting an
  analytical understanding.  An example of how this correspondence between
	the HO truncation and a hard wall at specific length plays out is
	presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_tail_matching}.

	\end{figure}
  %
	In the top panel, the exact
	ground-state radial wave function (dashed) for the square well in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:Vsw} is compared to the solution in an oscillator basis
	truncated at $\Nmax = 4$ determined by
	diagonalization (solid).  The truncated basis cuts off the tail of the
	exact wave function because the individual basis wave functions have a
	radial extent that depends on \hw\ (from the Gaussian part) and on the
	largest power of $r$ (from the polynomial part).  The latter is given
	by $\Nmax = 2n + l$.  With $\Nmax = 4$ and $l=0$, this means that $n=2$ gives
	the largest power.

	The cutoff will then be determined by the $n=2$ oscillator wave
	function, $u_{n=2}^{\rm HO}(r)$, whose square (which is the relevant
	quantity) is also plotted in the top panel (dot-dashed).  It is
	evident that the tail of the wave function in the truncated basis is
	fixed by this squared wave function.  Our premise is that the HO truncation
	is well modeled by a hard-wall (Dirichlet) bc at $r=L$.
	If so, the question remains how best to \emph{quantitatively} determine $L$
	given	$\Nmax$ and $\hw$.  In the bottom panel of
	Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_tail_matching} we show the wave functions	for several
	possible choices for $L$.
	$L_0$ corresponds to choosing the classical
	turning point (i.e. the half-height point of the tail of
	$[u^{HO}_{n=2}(r)]^2$); it is manifestly too small.  The authors of
	\cite{Furnstahl2012} advocated an improved choice for $L$ given by
	\beq
	\LA = L_0 + 0.54437\, b\, (L_0/b)^{-1/3} \;.
  \label{eq:LA}
	\eeq
	%
	The length $\LA$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:LA} is obtained by linear extrapolation
	from the slope at the half-height point.
	However, choosing
	\beq
	L = L_2 \equiv \sqrt{2 (\Nmax + 3/2 + 2)}b
	\label{eq:L2_def}
	\eeq
	was found to work the best in almost all examples.

	The most direct illustration of this conclusion comes from the
	bound-state energies.  In the example in Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_tail_matching},
	the exact energy (in dimensionless units) is $-1.51$ while the
	result for the basis truncated at $\Nmax=4$ is $-1.33$, which is therefore
	what we	hope to reproduce.  With $L_0$, the energy is $-0.97$, with $\LA$ it
	is $-1.21$, and with $L_2$ it is $-1.29$.  While this is only one
	example of a model problem, we have found that $L_2$ always gives a
	better energy estimate than $\LA$ (and something like
	$L_3 \equiv \sqrt{2 (\Nmax + 3/2 + 3)}b$ is almost always worse).

	Another signature that demonstrates the suitability of $L_2$ is that
	points from many different $\hw$ and $\Nmax$ values all lie on the same
	curve.  Figures.~\ref{fig:spatial_cutoff_vs_HO_gauss} and
	\ref{fig:spatial_cutoff_vs_HO_square_well} show the energies from a
	wide range of HO truncations for $L_0$, $\LA$ and $L_2$ for the
	Gaussian well and the square well potential, respectively.  The
	energies for different $\hbar\Omega$ and $\Nmax$ lie on the same smooth
	and unbroken curve if we use $L_2$ but not with the other choices.  For
	$L=L_0$ and $L=\LA$, one finds that sets of points with different
	$\hbar\Omega$ but same $\Nmax$ fall on smooth, $\Nmax$-dependent curves.  For
	the square well, there are small discontinuities visible even for
	$L=L_2$.  At the square well radius, the wave function's second
	derivative is not smooth, and this is difficult to approximate with a
	finite set of oscillator functions.  This lack of UV convergence is
	likely the origin of the very small discontinuities.

	%
	As a further test, we solve the Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a
	vanishing Dirichlet bc (solid lines in
	Figs.~\ref{fig:spatial_cutoff_vs_HO_gauss} and
	\ref{fig:spatial_cutoff_vs_HO_square_well}), and compare to the
	energies obtained from the HO truncations (crosses).  The finite
	oscillator basis energies are well approximated by a Dirichlet
	bc with a mapping from the oscillator $\hbar\Omega$
	and $\Nmax$ to an equivalent length given by $L_2$.  Note that for large
	$\Nmax$, the differences between $L_0$, $\LA$ and $L_2$ may be smaller
	than other uncertainties involved in nuclear calculations, but for
	practical calculations one will want to use small $\Nmax$ results, where
	these considerations are very relevant.

	These results from model calculations are consistent with those from
	realistic potentials applied to the deuteron.  To illustrate this, we
	use the N$^3$LO 500\,MeV potential of Entem and
	Machleidt~\cite{Entem:2003ft}.  We generate results in an HO basis
	with \hw\ ranging from $1$ to $100\,\mbox{MeV}$ and $\Nmax$ from $4$ to
	$100$ (in steps of 4 to avoid HO artifacts for the
	deuteron~\cite{Bogner:2007rx}).  We then restrict the data to where UV
	corrections are negligible (see Section~\ref{sec:UV_story}).

	Figure~\ref{fig:spatial_cutoff_vs_HO_deuteron} shows that the

	clearly favors $L_2$.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Analytical derivation of $L_2$}

	In the asymptotic region (this is the region where IR cutoff is imposed), the
	potential is negligible and the only relevant
	part of the Hamiltonian is the kinetic energy or the $p^2$ operator.
	In what follows, we analytically compute the smallest eigenvalue
	$\kappa^2_{\rm min}$ of $p^2$ in a finite oscillator basis and will
	see that $\kappa_{\rm min} = \pi/L_2$. In the remainder of this
	Subsection, we set the oscillator length to one. We focus on $s$-waves
	and thus consider wave functions that are regular at the origin, i.e.
	the radial wave functions are identical to the odd wave functions of
	the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.

	The localized eigenfunction of the operator $p^2$ with smallest
	eigenvalue $\kappa^2$ is
	%
	\bea
	\label{eigen}
	\psi_{\kappa}(r) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
	\sin{\kappa r}\ , & 0 \le r \le {\pi\over\kappa}\\
	0 \ , & r > {\pi\over\kappa}
	\end{array}\right. \; .
	\eea
	%
	We employ the $s$-wave oscillator functions
	%
	\bea
	\varphi_{2n+1}(r) &=&(-1)^n \sqrt{2 n!\over\Gamma(n+3/2)} r
	L^{1\over 2}_n\left(r^2\right)
	e^{-{r^2\over 2}} \nonumber\\
	&=&\left(\pi^{1\over 2} 2^{2n} (2n+1)!\right)^{-1/2}H_{2n+1}(r)
	e^{-{r^2\over 2}} \; , \nonumber
	\eea
	%
	with energy $E=(2n +3/2)\hbar\Omega$. Here, $L_n^{1/2}$ denotes the
	Laguerre polynomial, and it is convenient to rewrite this function in
	terms of the Hermite polynomial $H_n$. We expand the
	eigenfunction~(\ref{eigen}) as
	%
	\beq
	\label{expand}
	\psi_{\kappa}(r) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_{2n+1}(\kappa)\varphi_{2n+1}(r) \; .
	\eeq
	%
	Before we turn to the computation of the expansion coefficients
	$c_{2n+1}(\kappa)$, we consider the eigenvalue problem for the
	operator $p^2$.  We have
	%
	\beq
	p^2 = a^\dagger a +{1\over 2} -{1\over 2}
	\left(a^2 +\left(a^\dagger\right)^2\right) \;,
	\eeq
	%
	where $a$ and $a^\dagger$ denote the annihilation and creation
	operator for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, respectively.
	The matrix of $p^2$ is tridiagonal in the oscillator basis.
	For the matrix representation, we order the basis states as
	$(\varphi_1, \varphi_3, \varphi_5, \ldots)$. Thus, the eigenvalue
	problem $p^2-\kappa^2=0$ becomes a set of rows of coupled linear
	equations. In an infinite basis, the eigenvector $(c_1(\kappa),
	c_3(\kappa), c_5(\kappa), \ldots )$ identically satisfies every row of
	the eigenvalue problem for any value of $\kappa$. In a finite basis
	$(\varphi_1, \varphi_3, \varphi_5,\ldots \varphi_{2n+1})$, however,
	the last row of the eigenvalue problem
	%
	%\bea
	%\label{quant}
	%\lefteqn{\left(2n+3/2 -\kappa^2\right) c_{2n+1}(\kappa) =}\nonumber\\
	% &&{1\over
	%  2}\sqrt{2n}\sqrt{2 n+1}c_{2n-1}(\kappa) \ ,
	%\eea
	%
	\beq
	\label{quant}
	\left(2n+3/2 -\kappa^2\right) c_{2n+1}(\kappa) =
	 {1\over
	  2}\sqrt{2n}\sqrt{2 n+1} \, c_{2n-1}(\kappa) \; ,
	\eeq
	%
	can only be fulfilled for certain values of $\kappa$, and this is the
	quantization condition. To solve this eigenvalue problem we need
	expressions for the expansion coefficients $c_{2n+1}(\kappa)$
	for $n\gg 1$. Those can be derived analytically as follows.


	We rewrite the eigenfunction~(\ref{eigen}) as a Fourier transform
	%
	\beq
	\psi_{\kappa} (r) = \sqrt{2\over \pi} \int\limits_0^\infty dk
	\tilde{\psi}_{\kappa}(k) \sin kr \; ,
	\eeq
	%
	and expand the sine function in terms of oscillator functions as
	%
	\beq
	\sin kr = \sqrt{\pi\over 2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \varphi_{2n+1}(r)
	\varphi_{2n+1}(k) \; .
	\eeq
	%
	Thus, the expansion coefficients in Eq.~(\ref{expand}) are given in
	terms of the Fourier transform $\tilde{\psi}_\kappa(k)$ as
	%
	\beq
	\label{integ}
	c_{2n+1}(\kappa) = (-1)^n\int\limits_0^\infty dk\, \tilde{\psi}_{\kappa}(k)
	\varphi_{2n+1}(k) \; .
	\eeq
	%
	So far, all manipulations have been exact.  We need an expression for
	$c_{2n+1}(\kappa)$ for $n\gg 1$ and use the asymptotic expansion
	%
	\beq
	\label{approxwf}
	\varphi_{2n+1}(k) \approx {(-1)^n\sqrt{2}\over \pi^{1/4}}
	{(2n-1)!!\over \sqrt{(2n)!}}
	\sin (\sqrt{4n+3}k) \; ,
	\eeq
	%
	which is valid for $|k|\ll \sqrt{2n}$, see~\cite{gradshteyn}.
	%
	Using this approximation, one finds (making use of Fourier transforms)
	%
	\bea
	\label{phi}
	c_{2n+1}(\kappa) &\approx& \pi^{1/4} {(2n-1)!!\over \sqrt{(2n)!}}
	\psi_{\kappa}(\sqrt{4n+3}) \nonumber\\
	&=&\pi^{1/4}{(2n-1)!!\over \sqrt{(2n)!}}
	\sin (\sqrt{4n+3}\kappa) \; ,
	\eea
	%
	with $\kappa \le \pi/\sqrt{4n+3}$ due to Eq.~(\ref{eigen}).

	Let us return to the solution of the quantization
	condition~(\ref{quant}).  We make the ansatz
	%
	\beq
	\kappa = {\pi\over\sqrt{4n+3+2\Delta}} \; ,
	\eeq
	%
	and must assume that $\Delta > 0$.  This ansatz is well motivated, since the
	naive semiclassical estimate $\kappa = \pi/L_0$ yields $\Delta=0$. We
	insert the expansion coefficients~(\ref{phi}) into the quantization
	condition~(\ref{quant}) and consider its leading-order approximation
	for $n\gg 1$ and $n\gg \Delta$. This yields
	%
	\beq
	\Delta = 2
	\eeq
	%
	as the solution. Recalling that a truncation of the basis at
	$\varphi_{2n+1}$ corresponds to the maximum energy
	$E=(2n+3/2)\hbar\Omega$, we see that we must identify
	$\Nmax \equiv N = 2n$. Thus,
	$\kappa_{\rm min} = \pi/L_2$ is the lowest momentum in a finite
	oscillator basis with $n \gg 1$ basis states (and not $1/b$ as stated in
	Ref.~\cite{Coon:2012ab}).  It is clear from its
	very definition that $\pi/L_2$ is also (a very precise approximation of)
	infrared cutoff in a finite	oscillator basis, and that $L_2$ (and not $b$
	as stated in Refs.~\cite{Stetcu:2006ey,Stetcu:2007ms}) is the radial extent
	of the oscillator basis and the analog to the extent of the lattice in the
	lattice computations \cite{Luscher:1985dn}.

	The derivation of our key result $\kappa_{\rm min}=\pi/L_2$ is based
	on the assumption that the number of shells $N$ fulfills $N\gg 1$.
	Table~\ref{tab:L0_L2_k_min_comparison} shows a comparison of
	numerical results for
	$\kappa_{\rm min}$ in different model spaces. We see that
	$\pi/L_2$ is a very good approximation already for $N=2$, with a
	deviation of about 1\%.

	Note that this approach can be generalized to other localized
	bases.  The (numerical) computation of the lowest eigenvalue of the momentum
	operator $p^2$ yields the box size $L$ corresponding to the employed Hilbert
	space.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{EFT-like approach}

	We mentioned that the relevant operator for IR truncation is $p^2$.  To
	get a better understanding of the correspondence between the HO truncation
	and a hard wall at $L_2$, let's compare the spectrum of $p^2$ in the two
	cases.
	%
	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
	{Extrapolation/momentum_eigenfunctions1.pdf}
	\caption{Eigenfunctions of $p^2$ in the truncated HO basis compared to those
	  in a box of size $L_2$. }
	\label{fig:mom_eigen_fns}
	\end{figure}
	%
	In Fig.~\ref{fig:mom_eigen_fns}, we compare the low-lying eigenfunctions of
	$p^2$ in the truncated HO basis to the eigenfunctions in a box of size $L_2$.
	As we will see later, the asymptotic or near the wall difference between the
	two eigenfunctions are high-momentum effects irrelevant for the
	long-wavelength physics of the bound states.

	Another way to look at this is to compute the number $M(k)$ of ($s$-wave)
	states up to a momentum $k$.  We find
	\bea
	  M(k)&=& {\rm Tr} \left[\Theta\left(\hbar^2k^2-p^2\right)
	   \Theta\left(E-{p^2\over 2m}-{m\over 2}\Omega^2 r^2\right) \right]
	  \nonumber\\
	  &\approx&{1\over 2\pi\hbar} \int\limits_{-\hbar k}^{\hbar k}\! dp
	  \int\limits_0^\infty\! dr \,
	   \Theta\left(\hbar^2k^2-p^2\right)
	   \Theta\left(E-{p^2\over 2m}-{m\over 2}\Omega^2 r^2\right)
	   \; .
	\eea
	%
	Here, we apply the semiclassical approximation and write the trace
	as a phase-space integral.  We assume $\hbar^2k^2/(2m)\le
	E$, perform the integrations and use $E/(\hbar\Omega)= N+3/2$
	\footnote{For the sake of brevity we replace $\Nmax$ by $N$}. This
	yields
	%
	\bea
	  M(k) = {bk\over 2\pi}\sqrt{2N+3-b^2k^2}
	   +{N+3/2\over \pi}\arcsin{bk\over\sqrt{2N+3}}
	  \;,
	  \label{Mstair}
	\eea
	%
	where $b$ is the oscillator length.
	Figure~\ref{fig:staircase} shows a comparison between the quantum
	mechanical staircase function and the semiclassical
	estimate~(\ref{Mstair}) for $N=32$.  For sufficiently small values of
	$kb\ll\sqrt{2N}$, the number of $s$-wave momentum eigenstates grows
	linearly, and inspection of Eq.~(\ref{Mstair}) shows that the slope at
	the origin is $L_0/\pi$ semiclassically.  The linear growth of the
	number of eigenstates of $p^2$ with $k$ clearly demonstrate that --- at
	not too large values of $kb$ --- the spectrum of $p^2$ in the oscillator
	basis is similar to the spectrum of $p^2$ in a spherical
	box.

	  $p^2\le\hbar^2 k^2$.}
	\label{fig:staircase}
	\end{figure}

	As a final example of the correspondence between the HO truncation and the
	hard wall at $L_2$, we look at the ground state wave functions of a square
	well in the two bases in Fig.~\ref{fig:HO_q_and_rspace_sqwell}.
	%
	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]
	{Extrapolation/HO_q_and_rspace_sqwell_V0_4p0_Nmax8_hw18_v2}
	\caption{Ground-state wave functions for a square well potential of depth
	  $V_0=4$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:Vsw}; lengths are in units of $R$ and energies
		in units of $1/R^2$ with $\hbar^2/\mu = 1$) from solving the Schr\"odinger
	  equation with a truncated harmonic oscillator basis with $\hbar\Omega = 18$
	  and $N = 8$ (dashed) and with a
	  Dirichlet bc at $r=L_2$ given from Eq.~\eqref{eq:L2_def}
		(solid).  The coordinate-space radial wave functions in a) exhibit a
		difference at $r$ near 1.5, but the Fourier-transformed wave functions in
		b) are in close agreement at low $k$, showing that the differences are
		high-momentum modes.}
	\label{fig:HO_q_and_rspace_sqwell}
	\end{figure}
	%
	The binding momentum in this case is $1.7$ (in units of $1/R$).  The
	Fourier-transformed wave functions differ at much larger momentum and this
	difference is irrelevant for the long-wavelength physics of bound states.
	Thus the use of Dirichlet bc to take into account the HO
	truncation is similar in spirit to the use of contact interactions to
	describe the effect of unknown short-ranged forces on long-wavelength probes.


	\subsection{Cashing in on the hard wall correspondence}
	\label{subsec:make_cash}

	We have so far focused on establishing how HO truncation is analogous to
	putting the system in a spherical box of a specified radius.  Now let's see
	how this correspondence helps us in getting the exact energy $\Einf$.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Linear energy method}

	Our first approximation to the IR correction
	is based on what is known in quantum chemistry
	as the linear energy method~\cite{Djajaputra:2000aa}.  Given a
	hard-wall bc at $r=L$ beyond the range of the
	potential, we write the energy compared to that for $L=\infty$ as
	%
	\beq
	 E_L = E_{\infty}+\Delta E_L
	 \;.
	\eeq
	%
	We seek an estimate for $\Delta E_L$, which is assumed to be small,
	based on an expansion of the wave function in $\Delta E_L$.  Let
	$u_E(r)$ be a radial solution with regular bc at the
	origin and energy $E$.  For convenience in using standard quantum
	scattering formalism below, we choose the normalization corresponding
	to what is called the ``regular solution'' in
	Ref.~\cite{taylor2006scattering}, which means that $u_E(0) = 0$ and
	the slope at the origin is unity for all $E$.  We denote the
	particular solutions $u_{E_L}(r)\equiv u_L(r)$ and $u_{\Einf}(r)
	\equiv u_\infty (r)$. Then there is a smooth expansion of $u_E$ about
	$E=\Einf$ at fixed $r$, so we approximate~\cite{Djajaputra:2000aa}
	%
	\beq
	  u_L(r)\approx u_\infty (r) + \Delta E_L
	  \left.\frac{du_E(r)}{dE}\right|_{E_{\infty}}
	  + \mathcal{O}(\Delta E_L^2) \;,
	  \label{eq:linear_energy_approx}
	\eeq
	%
	for $r\leq L$.
	%
	By evaluating Eq.~\eqref{eq:linear_energy_approx} at $r=L$ with the
	bc $u_L(L)=0$, we find
	%
	\beq
	  \Delta E_L \approx -u_\infty(L) \left(\left.\frac{d u_E(L)}
	  {dE}\right|_{\Einf}\right)^{-1}
	  \;,
	  \label{eq:Delta_EL}
	\eeq
	%
	which is the estimate for the IR correction.

	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Extrapolation/linear_approx_v2}
	\caption{Testing the linear energy approximation
	  Eq.~\eqref{eq:linear_energy_approx} for (a) deep ($V_0=10$) and (b)
	  shallow ($V_0=2$) Gaussian potential well Eq.~\eqref{eq:Vg}
		($\hbar = \mu = R=1$).
	  The solid lines are the exact solutions $u_L(r)$ for energies $-3.5$
	  and $-0.020$, respectively, whose zero crossings determine the
	  corresponding values for $L$.}
	\label{fig:linear_energy_approx}
	\end{figure}

	We can check the accuracy of the linear energy
	approximation~(\ref{eq:linear_energy_approx}) by numerically solving
	the Schr\"odinger equation with a specified energy.  This determines
	$L$ as the radius at which the resulting wave function vanishes. Then
	we compare this wave function for $r \leq L$ to the right side of
	Eq.~(\ref{eq:linear_energy_approx}), with the derivative calculated
	numerically.  Figure~\ref{fig:linear_energy_approx} shows
	representative examples for a deep and shallow Gaussian potential.  In
	these examples and other cases, the approximation to the wave function
	is good, particularly in the interior.  The estimates for $\Delta E_L$
	using the right side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Delta_EL} are within a few to
	ten percent: 0.68 versus 0.70 and 0.050 versus 0.055 for the two
	cases.

	The good approximation to the wave function suggests that for the
	calculation of other observables the linear energy approximation will
	be useful.  For observables most sensitive to the long distance
	(outer) part of the wave function, such as the radius, this has
	already been shown to be true~\cite{Furnstahl:2012qg}. But the good
	approximation to the wave function at small $r$ means that corrections
	for short-range observables should also be controlled, with the
	dominant contribution in an extrapolation formula coming from the
	normalization.

	Next we derive an expression for the derivative in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:Delta_EL}.  To start with we assume we have a single
	partial-wave channel.  For general $E < 0$, the asymptotic form of the
	radial wave function for $r$ greater than the range of the potential is
	%
	\beq
	  u_E(r)\overset{r \gg R}\longrightarrow A_E(e^{-k_E r}+\alpha_E e^{+k_E r})
	  \;,
	  \label{eq:asymptotic_form_uE}
	\eeq
	%
	with $u_\infty(r)\overset{r \gg R}\longrightarrow \Ainf e^{-\kinf r}$
	for $E=\Einf$.  We take the derivative of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:asymptotic_form_uE} with respect to energy, evaluate at
	$E=\Einf$ using $\alpha_{\Einf}=0$ and $dk_E/dE = -\mu/(\hbar^2 k_E)$,
	to find
	%
	\bea
	    \left.\frac{d u_E(r)}{d E}\right|_{\Einf} &=&
	    \Ainf \left.\frac{d \alpha_E}{d E}\right|_{\Einf} e^{+\kinf r}
	    +
	    \Ainf \frac{\mu}{\hbar^2}\frac{r}{\kinf} e^{-\kinf r}
	    +
	    \left.\frac{d A_E}{d E}\right|_{\Einf} e^{-\kinf r}
	    \;.
	  \label{eq:entire_correction}
	\eea
	%
	We now evaluate at $r=L$ and anticipate that the $e^{+\kinf L}$ term
	dominates:
	%
	\beq
	  \left.\frac{d u_E(L)}{d E}\right|_{\Einf}
	  \approx \Ainf \left.\frac{d\alpha_E}{d E}\right|_{\Einf} e^{+\kinf L}
	   + \mathcal{O}(e^{-\kinf L})
	   \;.
	  \label{eq:substitute_this}
	\eeq
	%
	Substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq:substitute_this} into
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:Delta_EL}, we obtain
	%
	\beq \Delta E_L \approx -\left[ \left.\frac{d \alpha_E}{d
	      E}\right|_{\Einf}\right]^{-1} e^{-2 \kinf L} + \mathcal{O}(e^{-4
	  \kinf L}) \;.
	\eeq
	Note that this result is independent of	the normalization of the
	wave function.

	To calculate the derivative explicitly, we turn to scattering theory,
	following the notation and discussion in
	Ref.~\cite{taylor2006scattering}.  In particular, the asymptotic form
	of the regular scattering wave function $\phi_{l,k}$ for orbital
	angular momentum $l$ and for positive energy $E \equiv \hbar^2 k^2/2\mu$
	is given in terms of the Jost function
	$\Jost_l(k)$~\cite{taylor2006scattering},
	%
	\beq
	  \phi_{l,k}(r) \longrightarrow
	    \frac{i}{2}[\Jost_l(k)\hat{h}_l ^{-}(k r)-\Jost_l(-k)\hat{h}_l^{+}(k r)]
	    \;,
	    \label{eq:phi_asymp}
	\eeq
	%
	where the $\hat{h}_l^{\pm}$ functions (related to Hankel functions)
	behave asymptotically as
	%
	\beq
	\hat{h}_l ^{\pm}(k r)
	    \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}\longrightarrow e^{\pm i (k r - l \pi/2)}
	    \;.
	\eeq
	%
	The ratio of the Jost functions appearing in Eq.~\eqref{eq:phi_asymp}
	gives the partial wave $S$-matrix $s_l(k)$:
	%
	\beq
	   s_l(k) = \frac{\Jost_l(-k)}{\Jost_l(+k)}
	   \;,
	   \label{eq:s_l}
	\eeq
	%
	which is in turn related to the partial-wave scattering amplitude
	$f_l(k)$ by
	%
	\beq
	  f_l(k) = \frac{s_l(k) - 1}{2i k}
	  \;.
	  \label{eq:f_l}
	\eeq
	%
	We will restrict ourselves to $l=0$ for simplicity; the generalization
	to higher $l$ is straightforward and will be considered later.

	To apply Eq.~\eqref{eq:phi_asymp} to negative energies, we
	analytically continue from real to (positive) imaginary $k$.  So,
	%
	\bea
	   \phi_{0,ik_E}(r)
	       &\overset{r \gg R}\longrightarrow&
	         \frac{i}{2}\bigl(
		    \Jost_0(ik_E)e^{k_E r}-\Jost_0(-ik_E) e^{-k_E r} \bigr)
		 \nonumber \\
	       &=&
	       -\frac{i}{2}\Jost_0(-ik_E) \bigl(
	           e^{-k_E r} - \frac{\Jost_0(-ik_E)}{\Jost_0(ik_E)} e^{k_E r}
	         \bigr)
	       	\;,
	  \label{eq:asymptotic_form_phiE}
	\eea
	%
	where $R$ is the range of the potential.  Upon comparing to
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:asymptotic_form_uE} we conclude that
	%
	\beq
	  \alpha_E = -\frac{\Jost_0(ik_E)}{\Jost_0(-ik_E)}
	   = -\frac{1}{s_0(ik_E)} \;.
	  \label{eq:alphaE_and_S}
	\eeq
	%
	Note that Eq.~\eqref{eq:alphaE_and_S} is consistent with the
	bound-state limit of Eq.~\eqref{eq:asymptotic_form_uE}: at a bound
	state where $\Einf = -\hbar^2 \kinf^2/2\mu$ there is a simple pole in the $S$
	matrix, which means $\alpha_E = 0$ as expected (no exponentially
	rising piece).

	From Ref.~\cite{taylor2006scattering} we learn that the residue as a
	function of $E$ of the partial wave amplitude $f_l(E)$ at the
	bound-state pole is $\displaystyle (-1)^{l+1} \ANC^2 \hbar^2/2 \mu$,
	where $\ANC$ is	the ANC.  The ANC is defined by the large-$r$ behavior of the
	\emph{normalized} bound-state wave function:
	%
	\beq
	  u_{\rm norm}(r)\overset{r\gg R}\longrightarrow \ANC e^{-\kinf r}
	  \;.
	  \label{eq:definition_of_ANC}
	\eeq
	%
	Thus, near the bound-state pole (with $E = \hbar^2 k^2/2\mu$),
	%
	\beq
	  f_0(k)  \approx  \frac{- \hbar^2\ANC^2}{2\mu (E-\Einf)}
	      =  \frac{-\ANC^2}{k^2 + \kinf^2}
	   \;.
	\eeq
	%
	or, using Eqs.~\eqref{eq:f_l} and \eqref{eq:alphaE_and_S},
	%
	%\beq
	%  s_0(k) = \frac{k^2+\kinf^2 - 2 i k \ANC^2}{k^2+\kinf^2}
	%\eeq
	%
	%and therefore
	%
	\beq
	  \alpha_E(k) \approx -\frac{k^2+\kinf^2}{k^2+\kinf^2-2 i k \ANC^2}
	  \;.
	  \label{eq:alphaE_k}
	\eeq
	%
	Now,
	%
	\beq
	  \left.\frac{d \alpha_E}{d E}
	  \right|_{\Einf}=\frac{d\alpha_E/dk\vert_{k=i\kinf}}
	  {dE/dk|_{k=i\kinf}}
	  \;,
	\eeq
	%
	so using Eq.~\eqref{eq:alphaE_k} we find
	%
	\beq
	  \left.\frac{d\alpha_E}{d k}\right|_{k=i\kinf}=\frac{-i}{\ANC^2}
	  \;,
	\eeq
	%
	and therefore
	%
	\beq
	  \left.\frac{d\alpha_E}{dE}\right|_{\Einf}=\frac{-\mu}{\hbar^2 \kinf \ANC^2}
	  \;.
	\eeq
	%
	Putting it all together, we have
	%
	\beq
	  \Delta E_L = \frac{\hbar^2 \kinf \ANC^2}{\mu} e^{-2 \kinf L}
	    + \mathcal{O}(e^{-4 \kinf L})
	    \;.
	    \label{eq:complete_IR_scaling}
	\eeq
	%
	Equation~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling} matches the result
	\beq
	E(L) = \Einf + A e^{-2 \kinf L} + \mathcal{O}(e^{-4 \kinf L})
	\label{eq:exp_L_extrapolation}
	\eeq
	in \cite{Furnstahl2012}, but now we have identified
	$\displaystyle A = \hbar^2\kinf\ANC^2/\mu$.

	In \cite{More:2013rma}, we advocated including second term in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:entire_correction} for weakly bound states (small $\kinf$
	makes the term $\displaystyle \Ainf \frac{\mu}{\hbar^2}\frac{r}{\kinf}
	e^{-\kinf r}$
	non-negligible).  Including this term was also seen to give better prediction
	for weakly bound states like deuteron.  As we pointed out in
	\cite{Furnstahl:2013vda}, a better way to arrange an expression for
	$\Delta E$ is to have a systematic expansion in powers of $e^{-2 \kinf L}$.
 	Keeping the second term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:entire_correction}, generates terms
	in higher powers of $\mathcal{O}(e^{-2 \kinf L})$.  However, these higher
	order terms also arise from the $\mathcal{O}(\Delta E_L ^2)$ term in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:linear_energy_approx} and to be consistent
	we need to take in account contributions up to a given order from both the
	sources (i.e., Eqs.~\eqref{eq:linear_energy_approx} and
	\eqref{eq:entire_correction}).  As we will see below, relating $k_L$
	($k_L$ is the binding momentum when we have a hard wall at length $L$)
	directly to the $S$-matrix allows us to transparently obtain systematic
	expansion for $\Delta E$ in powers of $e^{-2 \kinf L}$.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{The $S$-matrix way}

	In \cite{Furnstahl:2013vda}, we returned to Eq.~\eqref{eq:asymptotic_form_uE}
	and noted that the bc uniquely fixed the coefficient
	$\alpha_E$.  We need $u_E(r = L) = 0$ which fixes
	\beq
	\alpha_E = -e^{-2 k_E L}\;.
	\label{eq:alpha_def}
	\eeq
	To make the $L$ dependence explicit, we modify the notation and let
	$k_L \equiv k_E$.  Comparing Eqs.~\eqref{eq:alpha_def} and
	\eqref{eq:alphaE_and_S}, we have
	\beq
	e^{-2 k_L L} = \left[s_0(i k_L)\right]^{-1} \;.
	\label{eq:basiceq}
	\eeq
	We then use appropriate parametrization for $s_0$ valid in the complex $k$
	region and solve the transcendental
	equation~\eqref{eq:basiceq} for $k_L$ and thereby find $E_L$.

	If the potential has no long-range part that introduces a singularity
	in the complex $k$ plane nearer to the origin than the bound-state
	pole (which is the case, for example, for the deuteron when we assume that
	the longest-ranged interaction is from pion exchange), then the
	continuation of the positive-energy partial-wave S-matrix (i.e., the
	phase shifts) to the pole should be unique.  Because $|k_L| <
	|\kinf|$, $s_0(i k_L)$ and therefore $k_L$ and the energy shift $E_L$
	should be determined solely by observables.

	The leading term in an expansion of $k_L - \kinf$ using
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:basiceq} comes from the bound-state pole, at which $s_0$
	behaves like~\cite{newton2002scattering}
	%
	\beq
	  s_0(k) \approx \frac{-i\ANC^2}{k-i\kinf}
	  \;.
	  \label{eq:purepole}
	\eeq
	%
	Note that $\ANC$ here is
	the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) defined in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:definition_of_ANC}.
	%
	Substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq:purepole} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:basiceq} yields
	%
	\beq
	  k_L - \kinf \approx -\ANC^2 e^{-2k_L L} \approx -\ANC^2 e^{-2\kinf L}
	  \;.
	  \label{eq:kLatLO}
	\eeq
	%
	This is the leading-order (LO) result for $k_L$ obtained in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling}.  Note that in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling}, $\displaystyle \Delta E_L \equiv
	E_L - \Einf = \kinf^2/2 - k_L^2/2$.  We set $\displaystyle \hbar^2/ \mu = 1$.
	The notation $\kinf$ for the exact binding momentum make sense in this
	context, because in the exact case, the hard wall is at $L = \infty$.

	Iterations of the intermediate equation  in \eqref{eq:kLatLO} motivate the
	NLO parameterization of $k_L$ as
	%
	\beq
	  k_L = \kinf + A e^{-2 \kinf L} + (B L + C) e^{-4 \kinf L}  +
		\mathcal{O}(e^{-6 \kinf L})
	  \;,
	  \label{eq:kLexpansion}
	\eeq
	%
	with $A = -\ANC^2$.  In general we can substitute this expansion into
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:basiceq} using an parametrized form of the S-matrix,
	then expand in powers of $e^{-2 \kinf L}$ and equate $e^{-2 \kinf L}$,
	$L e^{-4 \kinf L}$, and $e^{-4 \kinf L}$ terms on both sides of the
	equation.  However, while both $A$ and $B$ are uniquely determined by
	the pole in $s_0(k)$ at $k=i\kinf$, $C$ is only determined unambiguously if
	$s_0(k)$ is consistently parameterized away from the pole.  For
	example, the two parametrizations
	%
	\beq
	\label{eq:S0_1}
	    s_0(i k_L) \approx \frac{\kinf^2 - k_L^2 + 2 k_L \ANC^2}{\kinf^2 - k_L^2}
	\eeq
	%
	and
	%
	\beq
	  s_0(k) \approx \frac{-\ANC^2}{2\kinf}\,\frac{k+i\kinf}{k- i\kinf}
	  \label{eq:s0_Newton}
	\eeq
	%
	yield different results for $C$. The first
	parametrization~(\ref{eq:S0_1}) is based on a particular form for the
	partial-wave scattering amplitude near the
	pole~\cite{taylor2006scattering}, and was employed in
	Ref.~\cite{More:2013rma}.  The second paramerization
	(\ref{eq:s0_Newton}) correctly incorporates that the S-matrix also has
	a zero at $-i\kinf$~\cite{newton2002scattering}.  In neither case,
	however, do we have a sufficiently general parametrization that allows
	us to unambiguously determine $C$.

	For the complete NLO energy correction, we start from the
	general expression for the S-matrix
	%
	\beq
	  s_0(k) = \frac{k\,\cot\delta_0(k) + ik}{k\,\cot\delta_0(k) -ik}
	  \;,
	  \label{eq:s0_exact}
	\eeq
	%
	and use an effective range expansion to substitute for $k\,\cot
	\delta_0(k)$.  In particular, we use an expansion
	around the bound-state pole rather than about zero energy,
	namely~\cite{wu2011scattering,Phillips:1999hh},
	%
	 \beq
	  k\,\cot\delta_0(k) = -\kinf + \frac12 \rho_d(k^2 + \kinf^2)
	     + w_2(k^2+\kinf^2)^2 +  \cdots
	     \;.
	     \label{eq:eff_range_kinf}
	\eeq
	%
	To match the residue at the S-matrix pole as in \eqref{eq:purepole},
	we identify
	%
	\beq
	 \rho_d = \frac{1}{\kinf} - \frac{2}{\ANC^2}
	  \;.
	  \label{eq:rhoD_gamma_rel}
	\eeq
	%
	$w_2$ is a low-energy observable like $\ANC$ and $\kinf$.
	Now we substitute \eqref{eq:eff_range_kinf} into \eqref{eq:s0_exact}
	and use Eq.~\eqref{eq:kLexpansion} to expand both sides of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:basiceq}, equating terms with equal powers of
	$e^{-2\kinf L}$ and $L$. The resulting expansion for the binding
	momentum to NLO is
	%
	\begin{align}
    [k_L]_{\rm NLO} &=  \kinf - \ANC^2 e^{-2\kinf L}  - 2  L \ANC^4
		e^{-4\kinf L}
    \nonumber  \\
    &\null - \ANC^2 \left(1 - \frac{\ANC^2}{2\kinf} - \frac{\ANC^4}{4\kinf^2}
		+ 2 \kinf w_2 \ANC^4 \right) e^{-4\kinf L}
    \;.
    \label{eq:complete_k_correction_NLO}
  \end{align}
	%
	Using $\Delta E_L \equiv E_L - \Einf = \kinf^2/2 - k_L^2/2$,
	the correction for the energy due to finite $L$ is
	%
	\begin{align}
  	[\Delta E_L]_{\rm NLO} &=  \kinf \ANC^2 e^{-2\kinf L}
  	+ 2\kinf L\ANC^4 e^{-4\kinf L}
    \nonumber \\
  	& \null\quad +
    \kinf\ANC^2 \Bigl( 1-\frac{\ANC^2}{\kinf}-\frac{\ANC^4}{4\kinf^2}
    +
    2\kinf w_2 \ANC^4  \Bigr)  e^{-4\kinf L}
    \;.
    \label{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}
\end{align}
	%
	In what follows we use LO to refer to the first term in this expansion and
	L-NLO to
	refer to the first two terms (the second term should dominate the full
	NLO expression when $\kinf L$ is large).  We also note that
	higher-order terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:eff_range_kinf} (e.g., terms
	proportional to $(k^2+\kinf^2)^3$ and higher powers) do not affect the
	binding momentum or energy predictions
	Eqs.~\eqref{eq:complete_k_correction_NLO} and
	\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} at NLO.

	As a special case, let us consider the zero-range limit of a
	potential. In this case $\rho_d = w_2 = 0$, $\ANC^2 = 2\kinf$, and
	%
	\beq
	   [s_0(ik_L)]^{-1} = \frac{\kinf-k_L}{\kinf+k_L}\;.
	\eeq
	%
	The expansion for $k_L$ in a form similar to Eq.~\eqref{eq:kLexpansion}
	can be extended to arbitrary order using Eq.~\eqref{eq:basiceq}.

	We note finally that the leading corrections beyond NLO scale as $L^2
	e^{-6\kinf L}$. While we do not pursue a derivation of such high-order
	corrections here, the knowledge of the leading form is useful in some of
	the error analysis we present in Subsec.~\ref{subsec:pudding_proof}.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Differential method}

	Because we seek the change in energy with respect to a cutoff, it is
	natural to formulate the problem in the spirit of renormalization
	group methods by seeking a flow equation for the bound-state energy as
	a function of $L$.  Such an approach is already documented in the
	literature, for example in Refs.~\cite{Arteca1984} and
	\cite{Fernandez1981}, and it provides us with an alternative method that
	does not directly reference the S-matrix.  The basic equation is
	%
	\beq
	  \frac{\partial E_L}{\partial L} = -\frac12 \frac{|u'_L(L)|^2}
		{\int_0^L |u_L(r)|^2\, dr}
	  \;.
	  \label{eq:dEdL}
	\eeq
	%
	Here the prime denotes a derivative with respect to $r$.  Given an
	expression for the right-hand side in terms of observables ($\kinf$,
	$\ANC$, and so on) and $L$, we can simply integrate to find the energy
	correction for a bc at $L$
	%
	\beq
	  \Delta E_L \equiv E_L - \Einf = \int_{\Einf}^{E_L}\! dE\,
	     = \int_\infty^L\! \frac{\partial E_L}{\partial L} dL
	     \;.
	\eeq
	%
	To derive Eq.~\eqref{eq:dEdL}, we start with
	%
	\beq
	  \frac{\partial}{\partial L}\left [
	   \int_0^L u_L(r) H u_L(r)\, dr = E_L \int_0^L\! dr\, u_L(r)^2
	  \right]
	  \;,
	\eeq
	%
	which yields (after some cancellations)
	%
	\beq
	    \frac12 \left.\left( \frac{\partial u_L(r)}{\partial r}
	         \frac{\partial u_L(r)}{\partial L}
	         \right)\right|_0^L
	   =
	  \frac{\partial E_L}{\partial L} \int_0^L\! dr\, u_L(r)^2
	         \;.
	         \label{eq:DeltaEL}
	\eeq
	%
	The left-hand side is a surface term from partially integrating the
	kinetic energy in $H$.  The lower limit vanishes because $u_L(0) = 0$
	for any $L$.  Finally, we replace the partial derivative with respect
	to $L$ at the upper limit using
	%
	\beq
	   \frac{\partial u_L(L)}{\partial L} = - \frac{\partial u_L(L)}{\partial r}
	   \;,
	\eeq
	%
	which follows from expanding $u_{L'}(L') = 0$ about $u_{L}(L) = 0$ for
	$L' = L + \Delta L$.

	To apply Eq.~\eqref{eq:dEdL}, we start with $u_L(r)$ in the asymptotic
	region, as given by
	\beq
  	u_L(r) \overset{r \gg R}{\longrightarrow}  \left(e^{-k_L r} - e^{-2k_L L}
		e^{k_L r}\right)
   	\;.
   	\label{eq:uLasymp2}
  \eeq
	The normalization
	constant $\gamma_L$ is chosen so that the integral of $u_L(r)^2$ from
	0 to $L$ is unity; it becomes the ANC $\ANC$ as
	$L\rightarrow\infty$.  Thus
	%
	\beq
	   u_L'(L) = -2 \gamma_L k_L e^{-k_L L}
	   \;.
	   \label{eq:uLprime}
	\eeq
	%
	Now we need to expand $k_L$ and $\gamma_L$ about $\kinf$ and $\ANC$,
	respectively.  The leading term is trivial: $k_L \rightarrow \kinf$
	and $\gamma_L \rightarrow \ANC$, so the only $L$ dependence in
	$u_L'(L)^2$ is in $e^{-2 \kinf L}$ and the integration in
	\eqref{eq:dEdL} is immediate:
	%
	\begin{align}
	\Delta E_L
	     = \int_\infty^L\! \frac{\partial E_L}{\partial L} dL
	     =  -2 \ANC^2 \kinf^2 \int_\infty^L\! e^{-2\kinf L} \, dL
	     =  \kinf \ANC^2 e^{-2 \kinf L} +  \mathcal{O}(e^{-4 \kinf L})
	     \;.
	\end{align}
	%
	This is the same LO result for $\Delta E_L$ found by other methods.

	To go to NLO we need an expression for $\gamma_L$.  In the zero-range
	(zr) limit, $\gamma_L$ is given completely in terms of $k_L$ using the
	normalization condition (because the asymptotic form in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:uLasymp2} holds
	over the entire range of the integral)
	%
	\begin{align}
	  \gamma_L^2 &= \left[\int_0^L\! dr\, (e^{-k_L r} - e^{-2k_L L}e^{k_L r})^2
		\right]^{-1}
	  =
	  2 k_L(1 + 4 k_L L e^{-2 k_L L}) + \mathcal{O}(e^{-4 k_L L}) \;.
	\end{align}
	%
	We expand $k_L$ everywhere in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dEdL} using
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:uLprime} and our LO result
	%
	\beq
	   k_L = \kinf (1 - 2 e^{-2 \kinf L})
	   \;.
	\eeq
	%
	Here, we neglected terms that are $\mathcal{O}(e^{-6 \kinf L})$ or smaller.
	We need to expand $e^{-2 k_L L}$ in $u_L'(L)$ to get
	%
	\beq
	   e^{-2 k_L L} = e^{-2 \kinf L} (1 + 4 \kinf L e^{-2 \kinf L})
	    + \mathcal{O}(e^{-6 \kinf L}) \;.
	\eeq
	%
	(Elsewhere it suffices to replace $e^{-2 k_L L}$ by $e^{-2 \kinf L}$ to NLO.)
	So we find that
	%
	\begin{align}
	  \frac{\partial E_L}{\partial L} &= -\frac12 (4 \gamma_L^2 k_L^2
		e^{-2 k_L L})
	  \nonumber \\
	  &\approx -2  [2\kinf (1 - 2 e^{-2 \kinf L})(1 + 4 \kinf L
		e^{-2 \kinf L})]
	  \nonumber \\
	  & \  \null \times [\kinf^2 (1 - 4 e^{-2\kinf L})][e^{-2 \kinf L}
		(1 + 4 \kinf L e^{-2 \kinf L})]
	  \nonumber \\
	  &\approx
	  -4 \kinf^3 e^{-2 \kinf L} -  8 \kinf^3 (4\kinf L - 3)e^{-4 \kinf L}
	  + \mathcal{O}(e^{-6 \kinf L})
	  \;,
	\end{align}
	%
	and then finally
	%
	\begin{align}
	[\Delta E_L]_{\rm zr, NLO}
	     &= \int_\infty^L\! \frac{\partial E_L}{\partial L} dL
	     \nonumber \\
	     &=
	     2 \kinf^2 e^{-2 \kinf L} +  4 \kinf^2 (2\kinf L - 1)e^{-4 \kinf L}
	     + \mathcal{O}(e^{-6 \kinf L})
	     \;,
	\end{align}
	%
	in agreement with Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}
	with $\ANC^2 = 2\kinf$ and $w_2 = 0$.
	We can take this procedure to higher order by
	using a more general expansion for $k_L$.

	To extend the differential method
	to higher order for nonzero range, we must parametrize
	$\gamma_L$ to account for the part of the integration within the
	range of the potential; e.g., in terms of the effective range.  However,
	we have not found a clear advantage in doing this
	compared to the straightforward S-matrix method.

	\subsection{The proof of the pudding}
	\label{subsec:pudding_proof}

	In this subsection we will test the Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}
	for various test models and for the deuteron.  Note that for the cases
	that we test Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}, the exact answer
	$\Einf$ is already known (either by exact analytical calculation or by using
	large number of basis states).  So we can compare how good the prediction from
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} is by comparing to exact answer.
	In cases where the exact values for $\Einf$ and $\ANC$ are not known, our
	approach suggests that we can use the exponential in $L$ fit of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:exp_L_extrapolation} to extract $\Einf$ and $\kinf$.

	Based on the results
	presented in Subsect.~\ref{subsec:tale_of_tails}, we use $L_2$ in all our
	further analyses.
	%
	It is important that we isolate the IR corrections in making these
	tests.  The truncation in the HO basis also introduces an
	ultraviolet error inversely proportional to the ultraviolet cutoff
	$\Lambda_{\rm UV} \approx \sqrt{2 \mu \hbar \Omega (N+3/2)}$.  In the
	results here we use combinations of $\hbar \Omega$ and $N$ values such
	that the UV error in each case can be neglected compared to the IR
	error.

	For each of the model potentials, the radial Schr\"odinger equation is
	accurately solved numerically in coordinate space for the energy,
	which yields $\kinf$, and the wave functions.  The asymptotic
	normalization coefficient $\ANC$ is found by multiplying the wave
	function by $e^{\kinf r}$ and reading off its asymptotic value.  This
	is illustrated in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:IR_quartic_inset_ANC},
	which also shows the onset of the plateau that defines the asymptotic
	region in $L_2$ where we expect our correction formulas to hold.  For
	the deuteron, the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in
	momentum space to find $\kinf$, and then an extrapolation to the pole
	is used to find the $s$-wave and $d$-wave ANCs~\cite{Amado:1979zz}.
	In the present subsection we use only the $s$-wave ANC for the deuteron.

    function.}
		\label{fig:IR_quartic_inset_ANC}
	\end{figure}

	The derivations in Subsec.~\ref{subsec:make_cash} imply that the
	energy corrections should have the same exponential form and
	functional dependence on the radius $L$ at which the wave
	function is zero, independent of the potential and for
	any bound state.
	Here we make some representative tests of a direct fit of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:exp_L_extrapolation} in comparison to applying
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling}.

	Figure~\ref{fig:IR_quartic_inset_ANC} shows results for a quartic
	potential with a moderate depth.  The fit to
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:exp_L_extrapolation} is very good over a large range in $L_2$
	for which the energy changes by 30\%, and the prediction for $\Einf$
	is accurate to 0.2\%.  However, the fit value of $\kinf$ is 1.61
	compared to the exact value of 1.42.  The dashed curve shows the
	prediction from Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling} using the exact
	$\kinf$ and $\ANC$.  It is evident that the approximation is very good
	above $L_2 > 2$ but increasingly deviates at smaller $L_2$.

	%
	For deeply bound states, Eqs.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling} fails
	for a different reason.  The error in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling} is proportional to $e^{-4 \kinf L}$,
	so one might expect that the prediction to become increasingly
	accurate as the state becomes more bound.  However, as seen in
	Figs.~\ref{fig:deep_gauss_ANC_inset} and \ref{fig:deep_exp_ANC_inset},
	results for deep Gaussian and exponential potential wells do not match
	this expectation.  In deriving the energy corrections we used
	the asymptotic form of the wave functions.  This is valid only in the
	region $r \gg R$, where $R$ is the range of the potential.  The
	potentials at the smaller values of $L_2$ shown in the figures are not
	negligible.  Indeed, it is evident from the insets in
	Figs.~\ref{fig:deep_gauss_ANC_inset} and \ref{fig:deep_exp_ANC_inset}
	that we are not in the asymptotic region for those values of $L$.
	The lesson is that when applying the IR extrapolation schemes
	discussed in the present paper we need to make sure that the two
	conditions for its applicability are fulfilled.  First, we need $N$
	sufficiently large
	for $L_2$ to be the correct box size
	(see Table~\ref{tab:L0_L2_k_min_comparison}).
	Second we need $L_2$ to be the
	largest length scale in the problem under consideration.

  %
	The results so far are for the ground state of the potential.  However,
	the derivations in the Subsec.~\ref{subsec:make_cash} should
	also hold for excited states.  This is so because the generalization of
	the results in Subsec~\ref{subsec:tale_of_tails} shows that
	$(j\pi/L_2)^2$ is a very good approximation to the $j^{\rm th}$
	eigenvalue of the operator $p^2$ for $j \ll N$.  In
	Fig.~\ref{fig:IR_excited_gauss_quartic_wells} representative results
	for excited states from two model potentials are shown.  We find the
	same systematics as with the ground-state results: the exponential fit
	works very well but the extracted $\kinf$ is only correct at about the 10\%
	level.  In assessing the success of	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling}, we
	note that these excited states in deep potentials are comparable to the
	ground states in moderate-depth potentials shown in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:universal_sq_gauss_wells}.  The discussion there applies
	here as well, namely that the prediction from
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling} is very good at large $L_2$, but
	increasingly deviates at smaller $L_2$.

	The case of weakly bound states is of special interest because of the
	correspondence to deuteron which is also a weakly bound shallow state.
	Figure~\ref{fig:prediction_deuteron_equivalent} (a) shows ground-state
	energies for many different $N$ and $\hw$ versus $L_2$ using Gaussian model
	potentials whose parameters are chosen so that the energies are the

	$\mu=1$, $R=1$).
	In Fig.~\ref{fig:prediction_deuteron_equivalent} (b)
	we have a `deuteron-like' square well. The energies in this case are
	obtained by	solving the Schr\"odinger equation exactly with a Dirichlet
	bc on wave
	functions at $r=L$.  The prediction from Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling}
	fails to reproduce the data except at the highest values of $L_2$.
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling} keeps only the leading-order (LO)
	corrections	to $\Delta E$.  For the weakly bound states, the higher-order
	corrections become important.  The corrections to the energy up to the next
	to leading order (NLO) were noted in Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}.
	Note that the NLO correction involves the low-energy constant $w_2$.  In
	certain cases, this constant $w_2$ can be calculated and $\Delta E$ up to NLO
	can be obtained.  Now we turn to the test of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{NLO and systematics of the correction}

	For the square-well potential of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Vsw}, the parameters in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} can be calculated easily.
	The $S$-wave scattering phase shift for	the square well is
	%
	\beq
	 \delta_0 (k) =
	  \tan^{-1}\left[\sqrt{{k^2 \over k^2 + \eta^2}} \tan(\sqrt{k^2+\eta^2}
	  R)\right] - k R\;,
	  \label{eq:delta0}
	\eeq
	%
	with $\eta = \sqrt{2 V_0}$. 	Analytically continuing the effective
	range expansion by taking $k \rightarrow i k_L$
	in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:eff_range_kinf} and \eqref{eq:delta0}, we obtain
	%
  \begin{align}
	{i k_L \sqrt{\eta^2 - k_L^2} -k_L^2 \tan( \sqrt{\eta^2 - k_L^2} R)
	\tan(i k_L R) \over i k_L \tan(\sqrt{\eta^2 - k_L^2} R) -
	\sqrt{\eta^2 - k_L^2} \tan(i k_L R) }
	= -\kinf
	+ \frac12{\rho_d} (\kinf^2-k_L^2) + w_2 (\kinf^2 - k_L^2)^2
	\nonumber \\
	+ \mathcal{O}\left((\kinf^2-k_L^2)^3\right)	\;.
	\label{eq:get_w2_sq_well}
\end{align}
	%
	The branch for the square-root is fixed by the requirement that
	$\tan \delta (i\kinf) = -i$.  Note from Eq.~\eqref{eq:s0_exact} that
	this builds in the requirement that the $S$-matrix has a pole at
	$i \kinf$.  To get $\rho_d$ ($w_2$) we differentiate once (twice) each
	side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:get_w2_sq_well} with
	respect to $k_L$ and then set $k_L = \kinf$.  The $\rho_d$ obtained in
	this way is consistent with Eq.~\eqref{eq:rhoD_gamma_rel} when $\ANC$
	is obtained by the large $r$ behavior of the bound-state wave function
	as defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:definition_of_ANC}.

	The square well with a Dirichlet bc at $L > R$ can be solved analytically.
	The wave functions inside and outside the square well are
	\beq
  u^<_L(r) = C \sin\kappa_L r \,,
  \qquad
  u^>_L(r) = D(e^{-k_L r} - e^{-2 k_L L} e^{+k_L r})
  \;,
	\eeq
	%
	which builds in the boundary condition $u^>_L(L) = 0$.
	The interior wave number $ \kappa_L = \sqrt{\eta^2 - k_L^2}$ and
	$k_L = \sqrt{2 |E_L|}$.
	Matching the logarithmic derivatives at $r=R$ for $E=\Einf$ yields
	%
	\beq
	  \kappa_\infty \cot{\kappa_\infty R} = -\kinf
	\eeq
	%
	and with the boundary condition at $L$ we get:
	%
	\beq
	 \kappa_L \cot \kappa_L R = - k_L \frac{1 + e^{-2k_L (L-R)}}
	 {1-e^{-2k_L (L-R)}} \;.
	 \label{eq:sq_well_matchingL}
	\eeq
	%
	We expand both sides of Eq.~\eqref{eq:sq_well_matchingL} in powers of
	%
	\beq
	  \Delta k \equiv k_L - \kinf\;.
	  \label{eq:Delta_k_def}
	\eeq
	%
	We write the left-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:sq_well_matchingL} as
	%
	\beq
	\kappa_L \cot \kappa_L R = \kappainf \cot \kappainf R + \mathcal{A}
	(\Delta k)  + \mathcal{B} (\Delta k)^2+\cdots \;,
	\label{eq:LHS_matchingL_expansion}
	\eeq
	%
	and obtain the coefficients $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{B}$ by Taylor
	expanding $\kappa_L	\cot (\kappa_L R)$ around $\kinf$.
	We write $\Delta k$ as
	%
	\beq
	\label{eq:Delta_k_def2} \Delta k = k_{(1)} + k_{(2)} + \cdots \;.
	\eeq
	%
	Here $k_{(1)} \sim e^{-2 \kinf L}$ is the LO correction, $k_{(2)}
	\sim e^{-4\kinf L}$ is the NLO correction and so on, and we truncate the
	expressions consistently to obtain the energy correction for the
	square well to the desired order.  The results of the general S-matrix
	and square-well-only Taylor expansion methods of calculating energy
	corrections are found to match explicitly at LO, \LNLO, and NLO.
	We would like to remind that we use \LNLO to denote terms proportional
	to $L e^{-4 \kinf L}$.

	Figure~\ref{fig:sqwell_curvesV4} compares the energy corrections
	for the general S-matrix method at LO and NLO for a representative
	square-well potential with one bound state to the exact energies.  The
	Taylor expansion results for the square well at NLO and N2LO (which is
	proportional to $e^{-6\kinf L}$) are also plotted.  We note that the
	predictions are systematically improved as higher-order terms are
	included and that keeping terms only up to \LNLO~overestimates the
	energy correction.  Also as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sqwell_curvesV4},
	the full NLO energy correction predicted by
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}, with $w_2$ determined by
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:get_w2_sq_well}, matches the `exact' NLO result obtained
	by Taylor expansion.  This confirms that
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} is indeed the complete energy
	correction at NLO.

	To see if the errors decrease with the implied systematics, we plot
	the difference of actual energy corrections and the energy corrections
	predicted at different orders on a log-linear scale in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_error_log_plotsV4}.  We observe that the errors
	successively decrease at each fixed $L$ as we go from LO to NLO to
	N2LO.  The up triangles in Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_error_log_plotsV4} are
	$\Delta E_{\rm actual} - \Delta E_{\rm LO}$.  From
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} the dominant omitted
	correction in $\Delta E_{\rm LO}$ is proportional to $L e^{-4 \kinf L}$.
	As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_error_log_plotsV4}, the slope
	of $\Delta E_{\rm actual} - \Delta E_{\rm LO}$ is roughly $L
	e^{-4 \kinf L}$, as expected.  We also note that $\Delta E_{\rm \LNLO}$
	is only a marginal improvement over $\Delta E_{\rm LO}$ and that
	$\Delta E_{\rm actual} - \Delta E_{\rm NLO}$ has the expected slope of
	$L^2 e^{-6 \kinf L}$. We again see a perfect agreement between the
	results obtained from the S-matrix method
	\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} and those obtained from the
	Taylor expansion of Eq.~\eqref{eq:sq_well_matchingL}.  We have also
	studied deeper square wells with more than one bound state
	and verified that our results apply even in the presence of excited
	states.

	In Figs.~\ref{fig:sqwell_curves} and

	with the depth of the square well adjusted so that the exact binding
	energy is the same as the deuteron binding energy scaled to the units
	$\hbar=1$, $\mu=1$ and $R=1$. An important difference in this case
	compared to the deeper square well is that the \LNLO~prediction gives
	a very close estimate for the truncated energies.  However as seen in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_error_log_plots}, the improvement achieved by
	the \LNLO~prediction is not systematic with $L$.  At large $L$,
	$\Delta E-\Delta E_{\rm \LNLO}$ has the same slope as $\Delta E -
	\Delta E_{\rm LO}$ and is not the dominant NLO correction.  In this
	regard, the proximity of \LNLO~ prediction to the actual data in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:sqwell_curves} should not be over-emphasized.

	Figures~\ref{fig:deuteron_curves} and

	correction from Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} assuming a
	Dirichlet bc at $L_2$ given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:L2_def}.  We only include
	energies for which $\hw > 49$~MeV, which is sufficient to render UV
	corrections negligible.  For the parameter $w_2$ in
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} we use $w_2
	= 0.389$ as reported in \cite{Phillips:1999hh}.  We also note that the
	$\rho_d$ value reported in \cite{Phillips:1999hh} satisfies
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:rhoD_gamma_rel}, where $\ANC$ now is the $s$-wave ANC.
	The $y$-axis minimum is dictated by the limited precision of
	the ANC and $w_2$ values.
	We notice again that the close agreement of the \LNLO~prediction to
	the deuteron data is not systematic while the full corrections to the
	LO and NLO predictions have the anticipated slopes except at large
	$L_2$.  In the next Subsec.~\ref{subsec:higher_angular_momenta} we
	extend our formulas to $l>0$, which
	enables us to include contributions from the $d$-wave at LO.  This

	As a final test of the universal applicability of the correction
	formula Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO}, we consider a sequence
	of unitarily equivalent	potentials for the deuteron.  In particular,
	we use the similarity renormalization group (SRG)~\cite{Bogner:2009bt}
	to evolve the initial Entem-Machleidt
	potential to four values of the SRG evolution parameter $\lambda$.
	Because the transformation is exactly unitary (up to very small
	numerical errors) at the two-body level, the measurable quantities
	such as phase shifts, bound-state energies, and ANCs are unchanged.
	From Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} or more generally from
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:basiceq}, we see that the IR energy correction can written
	in terms of observables ($S$-matrix near the bound state can be
	parametrized in terms of low-energy observables) and therefore should be
	independent of the SRG scale.  This is verified in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:SRG_data_with_fit}.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Comparison to conventional extrapolation schemes}

	The extrapolation formulas in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling} and
	\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} with $L=L_2$ are theoretically founded.
	Thus the functional form for the energy extrapolation that we have is an
	exponential in $L$.  As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter,
	a popular	phenomenological choice is an exponential in $N$ extrapolation
	\big(Eq.~\eqref{eq:exp_Nmax_extrapolation}\big).  From
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:L2_def} we see that exponential in $N$ extrapolation
	corresponds to gaussian in $L$.  Authors of
	Ref.~\cite{Tolle:2012cx} investigated the convergence properties of
	genuine and smeared contact interactions in
	an effective theory of trapped bosons and found that the smearing
	changed a power law dependence of the convergence to an exponential
	dependence.  Here we will consider all three functional dependences on
	$L$: exponential, Gaussian, and power law.

	\label{fig:deuteron_other_forms}
	\end{figure}
	%
	A purely empirical test can be made for our models and the deuteron
	because we can calculate the exact $\Einf$, plot $\Delta E(L_2) \equiv
	E(L_2) - \Einf$ against $L_2$, and then attempt to fit each of the
	three choices of $\Delta E(L_2)$.  Figure~\ref{fig:Vgauss_other_forms}
	shows the results for a representative model potential (a Gaussian)
	with moderate depth while Fig.~\ref{fig:deuteron_other_forms} shows
	the results for the deuteron.  The plots are made so that the
	candidate form would yield a straight line if followed precisely.  We
	see that the exponential form is an excellent fit for the model
	throughout the range of $L_2$ and a reasonable but not perfect fit for
	the deuteron.  The not perfect fit for the deuteron can be explained
	by noting that it is a weakly bound state.  We see from
	Figs.~\ref{fig:deuteron_curves} and \ref{fig:deuteron_error_log_plots}
	that for deuteron, the correction will be a sum of exponential terms.
	In contrast to the exponential extrapolation, Gaussian and power law fits
	fail over the full range of $L_2$.  This is consistent with
	Tolle {\it et al.}~\cite{Tolle:2012cx}.  For limited ranges of $L_2$ a
	Gaussian does	provide a reasonable fit (and should give a good extrapolation
	for	$\Einf$ if close enough to convergence).  This is consistent with the
	apparent success of exponential in $N$ extrapolation observed in the
	literature.  However, we see that globally exponential in $L$ is clearly
	superior.  Moreover, the exponent and coefficient (see
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling}) are physically motivated whereas in the
	exponential in $N$ case (Eq.~\eqref{eq:exp_Nmax_extrapolation}) these
	parameters are fit to data.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Relation to L\"{u}scher-type formulas}

	Starting with the seminal work of L\"uscher~\cite{Luscher:1985dn}, a
	wide variety of formulas have been derived for the energy shift of
	bound states in finite-volume lattice calculations.  The usual
	application is to simulations that use periodic boundary conditions in
	cubic boxes (e.g., see Ref.~\cite{Konig:2011ti}).  The recent work by
	Pine and Lee~\cite{Lee:2010km,Pine:2012zv} extend the derivation to
	hard-wall boundary conditions using effective field theory for
	zero-range interactions and the method of images.  The result for
	$\Delta E_L$ in a three-dimensional cubic box has a different
	functional form than found here (the leading exponential is multiplied
	by $1/L$ with that geometry) and the subleading corrections are
	parametrically larger.

	However, because the HO truncation we consider is in partial waves,
	the one-dimensional analysis and formula from Ref.~\cite{Pine:2012zv}
	are applicable (because $\kinf$ and $\ANC$ are asymptotic quantities,
	the result for zero-range interaction is actually general for
	short-range interactions).  The method of images can be applied in a
	one-dimensional box of size $2L$ after specializing to a particular
	partial wave and then extending the space to odd solutions in $r$ from
	$-\infty$ to $+\infty$.  The leading-order finite-volume correction
	agrees with Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_IR_scaling}, and the first omitted term
	is of the same order.
	The methods presented in \cite{Lee:2010km,Pine:2012zv}
	can be used to extend the present formulas to higher
	orders and more general cases, including coupled channels.  This area
	is ripe for investigation.

	\subsection{Higher angular momenta}
	\label{subsec:higher_angular_momenta}

	The deuteron ground state is a mixture of an $s$ and a $d$ state, and
	the $s$ and $d$ asymptotic normalization coefficients (as well as the
	$d$-to-$s$ state ratio of about 2.5\%) are observables.  The
	extrapolation formulas so far were derived for $s$
	states, and it is of interest to extend these to nonzero angular
	momenta $l$.  We do so in two steps.  First, we show that $L_2$ is also
	the relevant effective hard-wall radius for oscillator wave functions
	with nonzero angular momenta.  Second, we derive the energy correction
	for nonzero angular momenta.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{$L$ for nonzero angular momenta}

	For the derivation of the relevant IR length scale at $l>0$ we closely
	follow the derivation for $l=0$ presented in
	Subsec.~\ref{subsec:tale_of_tails}.  We compute the smallest eigenvalue
	$\kappa^2$ of the squared momentum operator $\hat{p}^2$ in a finite
	oscillator basis and identify $\kappa =x_l/L$ (with $x_l$ being the
	smallest positive zero of the spherical Bessel function $j_l$). This
	identification, and the form of the corresponding eigenfunctions are,
	of course, guided by the Dirichlet bc at $r=L$.  We set the oscillator
	length $b=1$.  Because this is the only length scale here, the results
	are general and can be extended to any $b$ with simple rescaling.
	The normalized radial	oscillator wave function of energy
	%
	\beq
	  E=2n+l+3/2
	\eeq
	%
	is   $\psi_{nl}(r)=u_{nl}(r)/r$ with
	%
	\beq
	u_{nl}(r)=\sqrt{2n!\over\Gamma(n+l+3/2)} r^{l+1} e^{-r^2/2}
	L_{n}^{l+1/2}(r^2) \;.
	\eeq
	%
	Here, $L_n^{l+1/2}$ denotes the generalized Laguerre polynomial.

	In this basis, the operator $\hat{p}^2$ of the momentum squared is
	tridiagonal with matrix elements
	%
	\begin{align}
	\langle u_{ml}|\hat{p}^2|u_{nl}\rangle &= (2n+l+3/2)\delta_m^n \nonumber\\
	   & \qquad \null +\sqrt{n+1}
	   \sqrt{n+l+3/2}\,\delta_m^{n+1} \nonumber \\
	  & \qquad \null +\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+l+1/2}\,\delta_m^{n-1} \;.
	\end{align}
	%
	For the eigenfunction of $\hat{p}^2$ with smallest eigenvalue
	$\kappa^2$ at angular momentum $l$, we make the ansatz
	$\psi_{\kappa l}(r)/r$ with
	%
	\bea
	\label{eigen}
	\psi_{\kappa l}(r) =\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
	\kappa r j_l(\kappa r) \;, & 0\le \kappa r \le x_l \;, \\
	0 \;, & \kappa r > x_l \;.\end{array}\right.
	\eea
	%
	Here, $j_l$ is the regular spherical Bessel function and $x_l$ is its
	smallest positive zero.  Clearly, these eigenfunctions are those of a
	particle in a spherical cavity with a Dirichlet bc at $x_l/\kappa$. In
	an infinite basis, the wave function $\psi_{\kappa l}(r)/r$ is an
	eigenfunction of $\hat{p}^2$ for any non-negative value of $\kappa$.
	In a finite oscillator basis, only discrete momenta $\kappa$ are
	allowed.  For their computation we expand the eigenfunction as
	%
	\beq
	\psi_{\kappa l}(r) = \sum_{m=0}^{n} c_m(\kappa) u_{ml}(r) \;,
	\eeq
	%
	where we supress the dependence of the admixture coefficients
	$c_m(\kappa)$ on $l$, which is kept fixed throughout this derivation.

	The last row of the matrix eigenvalue problem for $\hat{p}^2$ is
	%
	\beq
	\label{quantize}
	(2n+l+3/2 -\kappa^2)c_n(\kappa) = -\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+l+1/2}\, c_{n-1} \;,
	\eeq
	%
	and this becomes the quantization condition for $\kappa$.  The direct
	computation of the coefficients $c_n(\kappa)$ seems difficult.
	Instead, we make a Fourier-Bessel expansion
	%
	\beq
	\label{fourierbessel}
	\psi_{\kappa l}(r)= \sqrt{2\over \pi}\int\limits_0^\infty\! dk\,
	   \tilde{\psi}_{\kappa l}(k)\, kr j_l(kr) \;,
	\eeq
	%
	and use
	%
	\beq
	kr j_l(kr) =\sqrt{\pi\over 2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n u_{nl}(k) u_{nl}(r) \;.
	\eeq
	%
	Thus,
	%
	\beq
	\psi_{\kappa l}(r)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n u_{nl}(r)
	\int\limits_0^\infty\! dk\, \tilde{\psi}_{\kappa l}(k) u_{nl}(k) \;,
	\eeq
	%
	and the admixture coefficients are therefore
	%
	\beq
	c_n(\kappa)= (-1)^n \int\limits_0^\infty dk\, \tilde{\psi}_{\kappa l}(k)
	u_{nl}(k) \;.
	\eeq
	%

	So far, our formal manipulations have been exact.  We now employ an
	asymptotic approximation of the generalized Laguerre polynomials
	(which enters the $u_{nl}(k)$) in terms of Bessel functions, valid for
	$n\gg 1$, see Eq.~(15) of Ref.~\cite{Deano2013}.  This yields
	%
	\begin{align}
	u_{nl}(k) \approx {2^{1-n}\over \pi^{1/4}} \sqrt{(2n+2l+1)!\over (n+l)! n!}
	   \,(4n+2l+3)^{-{l+1\over 2}}
	  %\nonumber \\
	   \sqrt{4n+2l+3} k\, j_l(\sqrt{4n+2l+3}k) \;,
	\end{align}
	%
	and
	%
	\begin{align}
	c_n(\kappa) \approx C_{nl} \sqrt{2\over \pi}\int\limits_0^\infty dk \,
	\tilde{\psi}_{\kappa l}(k)	\sqrt{4n+2l+3} k
	 j_l(\sqrt{4n+2l+3}k) \;.
	\end{align}
	%
	Here, $C_{nl}$ is a constant that does not depend on $\kappa$.  The key
	point is that the asymptotic expansion in terms of Bessel functions
	allows us now to employ the definition~\eqref{fourierbessel} to
	evaluate the integral
	%
	\begin{align}
	 \sqrt{2\over \pi}\int\limits_0^\infty dk\, & \tilde{\psi}_{\kappa l}(k)
	\sqrt{4n+2l+3} k\, j_l(\sqrt{4n+2l+3}k) \nonumber \\
	&=  \psi_{\kappa l}(\sqrt{4n+2l+3}) \nonumber \\
	&= \sqrt{4n+2l+3}\, \kappa\, j_l(\sqrt{4n+2l+3}\kappa) \;.
	\end{align}
	%
	Putting it all together, we find
	%
	\begin{align}
	c_n(\kappa) = {2^{1/2-n}(-1)^n \pi^{1/4} \over (4n+2l+3)^{l/2}}
	\sqrt{(2n+2l+1)!\over (n+l)!n!}
	\kappa\, j_l(\sqrt{4n+2l+3}\kappa) \;.
	\end{align}
	%
	We insert this expression for $c_n(\kappa)$ into the quantization
	condition~\eqref{quantize} and make the ansatz
	%
	\beq
	\kappa ={x_l\over\sqrt{4n+2l+3+2\Delta}} \ .
	\eeq
	%
	Assuming the limit $n\gg 1$ and $n\gg l$ in the quantization condition
	then yields
	%
	\beq
	\Delta=2 \ .
	\eeq
	%
	Thus, $\Delta$ does not depend on $l$ in this limit, and the result
	is consistent with the $l=0$ result of Ref.~\cite{More:2013rma}. In
	other words, the extent of the position space in finite oscillator
	basis with maximum radial quantum number $n$ and angular momentum $l$ is
	%
	\bea
	\label{L2}
	  L_2 &=& \sqrt{2(2n+l+3/2+2)}b \nonumber\\
	&=& \sqrt{2(N+3/2+2)}b \;,
	\eea
	%
	in accord with Eq.~\eqref{eq:L2_def}.

	Table~\ref{tab:lowest_kappa} shows numerical comparisons for $l=0,1,2$
	and a range of $n$ of the exact minimum momentum $\kappa$ and the
	estimate $x_l/L_2$ (with $x_0=\pi$, $x_1\approx 4.49341$, $x_2\approx
	5.76346$).  The estimates are accurate approximations of the exact
	results even for small $N=2n+l$, but the accuracy decreases somewhat
	with increasing orbital angular momentum. In some practical
	calculations it might thus be of advantage to directly employ the
	numerical results for $L_2$ instead of the approximate analytical
	expression~(\ref{L2}).

	\subsubsection{Energy correction for finite angular momentum}

	Let us extend our $l=0$ result for $[\Delta E]_{\rm LO}$ to $l>0$ following
	the	$S$-matrix method in Subsec.~\ref{subsec:make_cash}.
	For orbital angular momentum $l$, the asymptotic wave function is
	%
	\beq
  u_L(r) \overset{r \gg R}{\longrightarrow}  k_L r\Bigl(h_l^{(1)}(ik_L r) -
	{h_l^{(1)}(ik_L L)\over h_l^{(1)}(-ik_L L)}
	h_l^{(1)}(-ik_Lr)\Bigr) \;.
  \label{eq:uLasympl}
	\eeq
	%
	Here, $h_l^{(1)}$ denotes the spherical Hankel function of the first
	kind (or the spherical Bessel function of the third
	kind)~\cite{abramowitz1964}.  By definition $u_L(L)=0$.

	In complete analogy to the case of $s$ waves (e.g., using
	\eqref{eq:basiceq} and \eqref{eq:purepole} for general $l$), the
	correction $\Delta E$ of the energy at leading order is
	%
	\beq
	[\Delta E]_{\rm LO} = - \kinf \left(\gamma_\infty^{(l)}\right)^2
	{h_l^{(1)}(ik_L L)\over h_l^{(1)}(-ik_L L)} \ .
	\label{eq:ELO_general_l}
	\eeq
	%
	We note that
	\beq
	{h_l^{(1)}(ix)\over h_l^{(1)}(-ix)} \approx - e^{-2x}
	\eeq
	for $x\gg 1$.  In particular, for $l=1$
	%
	\beq
	[\Delta E]_{\rm LO} =\kinf \left(\gamma_\infty^{(1)}\right)^2
	{\kinf L+1\over \kinf L-1} \, e^{-2\kinf L}  \;,
	\label{eq:DeltaE_l1}
	\eeq
	%
	and for $l=2$
	%
	\beq
	[\Delta E]_{\rm LO} = \kinf \left(\gamma_\infty^{(2)}\right)^2
	{(\kinf L)^2 +3 \kinf L +3\over (\kinf L)^2-3\kinf L +3}\, e^{-2\kinf L} \;.
	\label{eq:DeltaE_l2}
	\eeq
	These corrections are tested in Fig.~\ref{fig:sq_well_error_plot_higher_l}.
	%
	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
	{Extrapolation/sq_well_err_P_D_states}
	\caption{Error plots of the energy correction at each $L$ for (a) $l = 1$ and
	(b) $l = 2$ square-well states predicted at leading order by
	Eqs.~\eqref{eq:DeltaE_l1} and \eqref{eq:DeltaE_l2} compared to the exact
	energy.  Lines proportional to the expected \LNLO~residual errors are plotted
	for comparison.}
	\label{fig:sq_well_error_plot_higher_l}
	\end{figure}
	%
	For coupled channels, the leading energy correction will be the sum
	of the LO corrections for the individual angular momenta.
	We note that lattices with periodic bc lead to energy shifts that
	depend on the angular momentum~\cite{Konig:2011nz}.
	In contrast, the basis truncations we consider in this work are
	variational and thus always yield a positive energy correction.

	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
	{Extrapolation/deuteron_error_log_plots_sd_v3test}
	\caption{Residual error for the deuteron energy due to
	  HO basis truncation as a function of $L = L_2$ (with $\hw > 49$~MeV
	  to eliminate UV contamination) after subtracting $l=0$ energy
	  corrections at different orders from
	  Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} and the $l=2$ correction
	  from Eq.~\eqref{eq:DeltaE_l2}.  For the parameter $w_2$ in
	  Eq.~\eqref{eq:complete_E_correction_NLO} we use the value reported
	  in \cite{Phillips:1999hh}.}
	\label{fig:deuteron_error_plot_l2}
	\end{figure}
	%
	We return to the deuteron and take
	$|\gamma_\infty^{(2)}/\gamma_\infty^{(0)}| \approx 0.0226/0.8843$ from
	Ref.~\cite{Machleidt:2011zz}.  Then
	%
	\beq
	[\Delta E]_{\rm LO} =\kinf \left(\gamma_\infty^{(0)}\right)^2
	e^{-2\kinf L}
	  \left[ 1 +
	\left|\frac{\gamma_\infty^{(2)}}{\gamma_\infty^{(0)}}\right|^2
	\frac{(\kinf L)^2 +3 \kinf L +3}{(\kinf L)^2-3\kinf L +3}\right]
	\;.
	\eeq
	%
	This formula is tested in Fig.~\ref{fig:deuteron_error_plot_l2} with
	the same deuteron calculations as in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:deuteron_error_log_plots}.  We note that the deviation
	after subtraction of the NLO ($l=0$) result does not exhibit the
	$\exp(-6k_\infty L)$ falloff but is rather consistent with an
	$\exp(-4\kinf L)$ falloff at large $L$.  We attribute this to the
	missing LO $d$-state correction.  Due to the small value of the
	$d$-to-$s$ state ratio, the $d$-wave correction is small, but it makes
	a perceptible shift of the $s$-wave LO result.  When added to the NLO
	$l=0$ correction, the large $L_2$ behavior of the error is brought
	somewhat closer in line with the predicted dependence of $L^2
	e^{-6\kinf L}$.  We note, however, that the NLO correction is not complete
	due to the missing $l=2$ correction.  Calculating NLO corrections for $l>0$
	remains an open question.  Particularly, because that would entail taking
	into account the admixture between different channels.

	\subsection{Radii and phase shifts}

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Radii}

	Along with binding energies, another nuclear observable that we looked at
	was the radius squared.  Figure~\ref{fig:deuteron_radii} shows the
	numerical results for the squared radius for the deuteron calculated in the
	HO basis.  Analogous to Figs.~\ref{fig:spatial_cutoff_vs_HO_square_well} and
	\ref{fig:spatial_cutoff_vs_HO_deuteron}, we see that the results for
	the squared radius fall on a continuous curve with minimal spread when
	plotted as a function of $L_2$ (but not as a function of $L_0$).
	%
	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
	{Extrapolation/Deuteron_radii_n3lo500_inset_v4}
	\caption{Deuteron radius squared versus $L_0$ (top) and
  	$L_2$ (bottom) for the Entem-Machleidt 500\,MeV N$^3$LO
  	potential~\cite{Entem:2003ft}.  The horizontal dotted lines mark the
  	exact radius squared $r^2_{\infty} = 3.9006~{\rm fm}^2$. The insets
  	show a magnification of data at smaller lengths $L_n$.}
	\label{fig:deuteron_radii}
	\end{figure}
  %

	Though the squared radius is a long-ranged
	operator, its matrix elements will still be modified at short distances
	by renormalizations or  similarity transformations of the Hamiltonian,
	see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{Stetcu:2004wh}.  Thus we cannot expect an extrapolation
	law for the radius that depends entirely on observables.
	Instead, we seek a formula that identifies the $L$ dependence but leaves
	parameters to be fit.  We define
	%
	\beq
	  \rsqav_L = \rsqinf + \Delta\rsqav_L
	  \;,
	\eeq
	%
	where
	%
	\beq
	  \Delta\rsqav_L =
	  \frac{\int_0^L |u_L(r)|^2\, r^2\,dr}{\int_0^L |u_L(r)|^2\, dr}
	  - \frac{\int_0^\infty |u_\infty(r)|^2\, r^2\,dr}{\int_0^\infty
		|u_\infty(r)|^2\, dr} \;.
	  \label{eq:Delta-rsq}
	\eeq
	%
	The strategy is to isolate the polynomial $L$ dependence by splitting the
	necessary integrals into an interior part and an exterior part:
	\beq
  \int_0^L\! r^n |u_L(r)|^2\, dr =
  \int_0^R\! r^n |u_L(r)|^2\, dr + \int_R^L\! r^n |u_L(r)|^2\, dr \;,
  \label{eq:rnintegral}
	\eeq
	%
	where $R$ is sufficiently large so that the asymptotic form of $u_L(r)$ from
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:uLasymp2} can be used in the second integral.
	Our expression for $\Delta\rsqav_L$ is independent of the normalization
	of $u_L(r)$, so we are free to choose it so that the large $r$ form is
	exactly given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:uLasymp2}.

	The first integral in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnintegral} will depend on the details
	of the interior wave function	and therefore on the potential, but
	the linear energy method shows us that to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-2\kinf L})$
	the $L$ dependence is isolated.  In particular, the dependence on $L$ of
	$u_L(r)$ in	Eq.~\eqref{eq:linear_energy_approx} is confined to
	$\Delta E_L = \kinf\ANC^2 e^{-2\kinf L}$ because $du_E(r)/dE|_{\Einf}$ for
	$r < R$ is independent of $L$ with our choice of normalization.  Thus the
	integral over $r$ cannot introduce polynomial $L$ dependence and we can
	conclude that
	%
	\beq
  \int_0^R\! r^n |u_L(r)|^2\, dr = \mathcal{O}(L^0) e^{-2\kinf L}
	     + \mathcal{O}(e^{-4\kinf L}) \;.
	\eeq
	%
	The $\mathcal{O}(L^0)$ coefficient will depend on the potential, so we
	will treat it as a parameter to be fit.

	The second integral can be directly evaluated to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-2\kinf L})$
	using Eq.~\eqref{eq:uLasymp2} and $[k_L]_{LO} = \kinf - \ANC^2 e^{-2\kinf L}$
	to expand $|u_L(r)|^2$.  For $n=0$ we find
	%
	\begin{align}
	  \int_R^L\! &|u_L(r)|^2\, dr =  \frac{1}{2\kinf}e^{-2\kinf R} + \Bigl[
	  \frac{\ANC^2}{\kinf} \Bigl(R + \frac{1}{2\kinf}\Bigr)e^{-2\kinf R} + 2R -
		2L \Bigr]e^{-2\kinf L} + \mathcal{O}(e^{-4\kinf L}) \;,
	  \label{eq:asympnorm}
	\end{align}
	%
	and for $n=2$ we find
	%
	\begin{align}
  	\int_R^L\! r^2 |u_L(r)|^2\, dr =
  	\frac{1}{2\kinf^3}\Bigl[ \frac12 + \kinf R + (\kinf R)^2 \Bigr]
		e^{-2\kinf R}
    \nonumber \\
		\null +  \Bigl[ \frac{\ANC^2}{\kinf^4} \Bigl( \frac34 + \frac32\kinf R +
		\frac32(\kinf R)^2 + (\kinf R)^3 \Bigr)e^{-2\kinf R}  \nonumber \\
    \null + \frac{1}{\kinf^3} \Bigl( \frac23 (\kinf R)^3 - \kinf L - \frac23
		(\kinf L)^3 \Bigr) \Bigr]e^{-2\kinf L}
    % \nonumber \\
		+ \mathcal{O}(e^{-4\kinf L})  \;.
    \label{eq:asymprsq}
	\end{align}
	%
	Note that it is necessary to keep the expansion of $|u_L(r)|^2$ up to
	$e^{-4\kinf L}$	until after doing the integrals because terms proportional
	to $e^{-4\kinf L} e^{2\kinf r}$ will be leading order.

	When we use \eqref{eq:asympnorm} and \eqref{eq:asymprsq} and our previous
	result for the interior integrals in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Delta-rsq}, expanding
	consistently to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-2\kinf L})$, we will mix $R$-dependent
	terms with the $L$ dependence.  However, we can immediately conclude that
	the general form to this order is (with $\beta \equiv 2\kinf L$)
	%
	\bea
	 	\rsqav_L \approx {\rsqinf}[ 1 - (c_0 \beta^3 +c_1 \beta + c_2) e^{-\beta}]
	  \;.
		\label{rad}
	\eea
	%
	Here, $\rsqinf$, $c_0$, $c_1$, and $c_2$ are fit parameters while $\kinf$
	should be determined from fitting the energy. 	This form has been verified
	explicitly for finite-range model potentials (e.g., square well
	and delta shell). 	The approximation~(\ref{rad}) should be valid
	in the asymptotic regime $\beta\gg 1$.  In practice, one needs
	$\beta\gtrsim 3$ so that the dominant $\beta^3$ correction is
	approximately an order of magnitude larger than the subleading terms
	(with $c_1$ and $c_2$ expected to be roughly the same size as
	$c_0$ or smaller).

	If we take the zero-range limit $R\to 0$ of the potential, we
	arrive at the simple expression
	%
	\beq
	 \frac{\Delta\rsqav_L}{\rsqinf}
	 \approx -\left(\frac{(2\kinf L)^3}{3} -4\right) e^{-2\kinf L} \;.
	 \label{eq:rsqzerorange}
	\eeq
	%
	Note that in this limit the correction becomes independent of the potential.
	Equation~\eqref{eq:rsqzerorange} suggests that for a short-range potential,
	the $c_1$ and $c_2$ terms will give comparable contributions for moderate
	$\beta$, and therefore will be difficult to determine reliably.

	The values for $\rsqinf$ and the coefficients $c_i$'s from the fits in

	For all of these fits, the value of $c_0$ is
	fairly stable, ranging from 0.27 to 0.33 (note that
	$c_0 = 1/3$ in the zero-range limit).  In contrast, $c_1$
	and $c_2$ are not well determined (even the sign of $c_1$
	varies).  This is consistent with
	fits using the square-well potential, where analytic expressions
	for the $c_i$s can be found.  We find that $\rsqinf$
	and $c_0$ are well determined by fits in analogous
	regions but that $c_1$ and $c_2$ are not.
	If we push the analysis by taking the fit region between 7 and 13\,fm,
	the $\rsqinf$ prediction using only $c_0$ breaks down, giving
	4.21\,fm$^2$.  However, the fit with all three $c_i$s is still
	reasonable, giving 3.86\,fm$^2$.  This indicates the importance of using
	the correct functional form for extrapolation.
	Further studies are needed to test how these trends might carry
	over to $A>2$ nuclei.  It is worthwhile to note that this approach can
	be generalized to any coordinate space operator.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Phase shifts}

	The argument for computing scattering phase shifts is as
	follows: The oscillator basis appears as a spherical box of size
	$L$.  For low momenta we have $L=L_2$, but at higher momentum $L$
	deviates slightly from $L_2$, and can be determined from the
	eigenvalues of the operator $p^2$.  Thus, the positive-energy states
	computed in the oscillator basis can be used to extract phase shifts.

	In a fixed harmonic oscillator basis ($N,\hbar\Omega$), the
	computation of the phase shifts for a given partial wave $^{2S+1}l_J$
	with orbital angular momentum $l$ proceeds as follows: First, one
	computes the discrete eigenvalues $p_i^2$ of the operator $p^2$ for
	orbital angular momentum $l$.  Second, we need to determine the
	momentum dependent box size $L_i=L(p_i)$.  Assuming that the $i^{\rm th}$
	momentum eigenstate is the $i^{\rm th}$ eigenstate of a
	spherical box, we must determine the $i^{\rm th}$ zero of the
	spherical Bessel function.  Thus $j_l(p_iL_i/\hbar) = 0 $ determines
	$L(p_i)$.  We evaluate the smooth function $ L(p)$ for arbitrary
	momentum $p$ by interpolating between the discrete momenta
	$p_i$.  Third, we compute the discrete positive energies $E_i =
	\hbar^2k_i^2/(2m)$ of the neutron-proton system in relative
	coordinates for the partial wave $^{2S+1}l_J$, and compute the phase
	shifts from the Dirichlet boundary condition at $r=L$, i.e.
	%
	\beq
	\tan\delta_l(k_i) = { j_l(k_iL(\hbar k_i)) \over \eta_l(k_iL(\hbar k_i))}\;.
	\eeq
	%
	Here $\eta_l$ is the spherical Neumann function.  In practice one
	repeats this procedure for several values of $\hbar\Omega$ in order to
	get sufficiently many datapoints that fall onto a smooth curve.
	Note that for $E_i$ or $k_i$ are obtained from diagonalizing the nuclear
	Hamiltonian in HO basis whereas $p_i$ are obtained from diagonalizing the
	momentum squared operator.

	%
	As examples we compute the scattering phase shifts for the $^1$S$_0$ and
	$^3$P$_1$	partial waves in model spaces with $N=32$ and
	$\hbar\Omega=20,22,\ldots,40$~MeV.  Our calculations are based on the
	Entem-Machleidt 500\,MeV chiral EFT N$^3$LO
	potential~\cite{Entem:2003ft}.  Figures~\ref{fig:1s0phase} and
	\ref{fig:3p1phase} show the results and compares them to the numerically
	exact phase	shifts.  For smaller $N$ than our current choice, the
	computed phase shifts start to deviate from exact phase shifts at
	higher energies.  However, if one is interested only in low-energy
	phase shifts and observables such as the scattering length and the
	effective range, a smaller harmonic oscillator basis is sufficient.

	There are other methods to compute scattering phase shifts in the
	harmonic oscillator basis.  Bang \emph{et al.} \cite{bang2000} used the
	method of harmonic oscillator representation of scattering equations
	(HORSE) for this purpose, and more recent
	works~\cite{Luu:2010hw,Stetcu:2009ic} computed phase shifts to develop an
	EFT for nuclear interactions directly in the oscillator
	basis~\cite{Stetcu:2006ey}.  References~\cite{Luu:2010hw,Stetcu:2009ic}
	build on the results by Busch {\it et al.}~\cite{busch1998} and their
	generalization~\cite{Bhattacharyya:2006fg} to finite range corrections,
	and extract scattering information from the energy shifts of bound
	states in a harmonic oscillator potential.  The resulting EFTs are
	quite efficient for contact interactions and systems such as ultracold
	trapped fermions, but nuclear potentials with a finite range require
	an extrapolation of $\Omega\to 0$~\cite{Luu:2010hw}.  The approach
	presented in this Subsection is more direct, as no external oscillator
	potential is employed.  We note that the phase shift analysis presented
	here can be extended to coupled channels as well.

	Finally, we note again that the approach of this Section can be
	utilized in other localized basis sets.  All that is required is the
	diagonalization of the operator $p^2$ in the employed basis set, which
	yields the (momentum dependent) box size.


	\section[Ultraviolet story]
	{Ultraviolet story \footnote{Based on \cite{Konig:2014hma}}}
	\label{sec:UV_story}

  In Sec.~\ref{sec:IR_story} we worked in the region where the UV errors were
	small and focused on the IR errors.  However, for many methods full
	suppression of the UV errors is not feasible and the need to understand
	UV corrections remains.  In all cases the UV effect is a systematics error
	that must be quantified.  In addition, this error worsens for harder
	nucleon--nucleon potentials	that may still be of interest.  Finally,
	we seek an understanding of
	the successes (and limitations) of previous phenomenological forms.
  %
	We follow the strategy of Sec.~\ref{sec:IR_story} by focusing on the
	two-body problem and exactly solvable examples to establish the true
	UV behavior for the	simple systems and then make correspondence to the
	nuclear systems.

	\subsection{Duality and momentum-space boxes}
	\label{subsec:UV_cutoff_duality}

	To briefly recap results in Subsec.~\ref{subsec:tale_of_tails}---we
	demonstrated there that a
	truncated oscillator basis with highest excitation energy
	$N\Omega$ effectively imposes a spherical hard-wall boundary condition
	at a radius depending on $N$ and $b$.  The optimal effective radius
	$\Leff$ can be determined by matching the smallest eigenvalue
	$\kappa^2$ of the squared momentum operator $p^2$ in the finite
	basis to the corresponding eigenvalue of the spherical box, namely
	$\kappa=\pi/L$ (for $\ell=0$).  The value can be established numerically,
	but an accurate approximation for the two-body system is
	%
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:L2_def}
	  \Leff = L_2\equiv\sqrt{2(N+3/2+2)}b \,.
	\end{equation}
	%
	Note that $L_2$ differs by $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ from the naive estimate
	$L_0\equiv\sqrt{2(N+3/2)}b$.  In localized bases that differ from the
	harmonic oscillator, $L$ can also be determined from a numerical
	diagonalization of the operator $p^2$.

	The dual nature of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:H-HO}
	(\ie, under $p \leftrightarrow \mu\Omega r$) implies that the
	truncation of the basis will effectively impose a sharp cutoff at a
	momentum $\Lameff$ depending only on $N$ and $b$.  The analog matching
	condition leads us to consider the smallest eigenvalue (denoted $\rho$) of
	the operator $r^2$ evaluated in that truncated basis.  This eigenvalue is
	identical to the smallest (squared) distance that can be realized in the
	oscillator basis.  Thus it corresponds to a lattice spacing on a grid
	and therefore sets the highest momentum available.  As we see
	in Fig.~\ref{fig:deuteron_lambdas}, the square root of the largest
	eigenvalue of the squared momentum operator, which might be a natural guess
	for the effective UV cutoff, is not an accurate estimate for $\Lameff$.

	The smallest eigenvalue $\rho$ is determined by Eqs.~\eqref{eq:quant-cond-ell}
	and~\eqref{eq:c-tilde-2} in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_Lambda-Details}.
	From steps completely analogous (dual) to those given in
	Subsec.~\ref{subsec:tale_of_tails} for the IR case, we find that
	the solution (in a subspace with fixed angular momentum $\ell$) is
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \rho = \frac{x_\ell b}{\sqrt2}\left(\Nmax+\frac32+\Delta\right)^{\!-1/2}
	\label{eq:rho-Nmax-Delta}
	\end{equation}
	%
	with $\Delta=2$ to leading order.  The constant $x_\ell$ in the prefactor is
	the first positive zero of the spherical Bessel function $j_\ell$.  Since the
	UV cutoff is given by $x_\ell/\rho$, it drops out again in our final
	result:
	%
	\begin{equation}
	\Lambda_2 \equiv \sqrt{2(\Nmax+3/2+2)}/b \,.
	\label{eq:Lambda-2-simple}
	\end{equation}
	%
	Hence, we have shown that the proper effective UV cutoff imposed by
	the basis truncation is given by $\Lambda_2$, which differs by a correction
	term from the naive estimate
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \Lambda_0 \equiv \sqrt{2(\Nmax+3/2)}/b
	\label{eq:Lambda-0}
	\end{equation}
	%
	that one obtains by simply considering the maximum single-particle energy
	level represented by the truncated basis.  We note that subleading corrections
	to $\Delta=2$, which by duality apply equally to the IR and UV cutoff, are
	derived in Appendix~\ref{subsec:appendix_subleading}.

	%
	For an oscillator basis truncation with general $b$ and $\Nmax$, both
	IR and UV errors will be significant.  However, by choosing
	appropriate ranges of these parameters we can isolate one or the other
	and thereby analyze them separately (the combined effect is yet to be
	investigated).  In Fig.~\ref{fig:IR_deuteron_HO}(a) we
	plot the relative error in the deuteron energy $\Delta E_d/E_d$ for a
	large set of basis parameters with $4 < \Nmax < 100$ and
	$1\,\mbox{MeV} < \Omega < 100\,\mbox{MeV}$ against the value of $L_2$
	(recall $\Omega = 1/\mu b^2$) from Eq.~\eqref{eq:L2_def}.  The
	calculations use the 500\,MeV N$^3$LO nucleon-nucleon $NN$ potential
	of Ref.~\cite{Entem:2003ft}, evolved by the
	SRG~\cite{Bogner:2006pc} to
	$\lambda = 2\,\fmi$.  For sufficiently large $\Omega$, above a minimum
	$\Nmax$ all points collapse to a single exponential curve that runs
	over six decades (at which point numerical errors in the calculation
	are reached and cause the curve to flatten)\footnote{This effect is analogous
	to what is shown in Fig.~4 in Ref.~\cite{Coon:2012ab}.  Once the calculation
	is converged in the UV regime, the curves in such error plots flatten out at
	a value determined by whatever else limits the precision of the calculation.
	In Fig.~4 in Ref.~\cite{Coon:2012ab}, the value of the plateau is different
	for each curve because the data points have not been filtered to ensure
	convergence in the IR.  In our case, the value is determined by the numerical
	precision	of the calculation, which is reflected in the fact that the
	plateaus are the same in Figs.~\ref{fig:IR_deuteron_HO} and
	\ref{fig:UV_deuteron_HO}.}). 	These are the UV-converged points; that is,
	those for which the UV correction	is much smaller than the IR correction.

	In Fig.~\ref{fig:IR_deuteron_HO}(b) these same UV-converged points are
	plotted (labeled ``raw'').  They are seen to form a smooth line
	with little spread; this is a signature that $L_2$ is the correct
	variable for the effective box size (see Subsec.~\ref{subsec:tale_of_tails})
	(if $L_0$ were used instead there would be a small but noticeable scatter).
	It is
	also evident from the straightness of the line on a semi-log plot that the
	functional form is dominantly an exponential over most of the range of
	$\Delta E_d/E_d$.  This exponential is predicted by the systematic
	expansion derived	in Subsec.~\ref{subsec:make_cash}, for
	which successive orders are suppressed by powers of $\ee^{-2\kinf L_2}$,
	where $\kinf$ is the deuteron binding momentum.  (There are also
	pre-factors that are low-order polynomials in $L_2$.)  If we subtract
	the leading correction, the result is the steeper exponential
	(proportional to $\ee^{-4\kinf L_2}$) labeled ``LO.''  Finally, if we
	subtract the NLO correction for only the S-wave part, we get the still
	steeper
	exponential (``NLO S-wave''), which is valid down to $10^{-5}$.  Thus we
	conclude that the IR corrections are well understood for the deuteron.
	What is	not evident from these plots alone, but is documented in
	Subsec.~\ref{subsec:pudding_proof}, is that the same results in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:IR_deuteron_HO}(b) would be obtained with another potential as
	long as it was S-matrix equivalent at low energies (same phase shifts and
	deuteron properties, as from a unitary transformation).  In this sense, the IR
	corrections are universal.

	Next we try in Fig.~\ref{fig:UV_deuteron_HO}(a) to isolate the
	IR-converged points with an analogous plot of the relative error in
	the deuteron energy but now as a function of $\Lambda_2$. There is a
	much greater spread of points, indicating that it is more difficult to
	have the IR error much smaller than the UV error, at least for a
	conventional range of $\Omega$.  However, for very low $\Omega$ we do
	find points collapsed to a single curve.  These points, for which $L_2
	> 40\,$fm (to reach IR errors smaller than UV errors), are plotted in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:UV_deuteron_HO}(b).  Just as in the case of isolated
	IR corrections, we find that a signature both of IR convergence
	and that $\Lambda_2$ is the appropriate variable is a smooth curve
	with little scatter of points.  But the functional dependence is
	manifestly \emph{not} dual: there are no straight-line segments in a
	semi-log plot.  The phenomenological treatment of the UV correction
	suggested in Ref.~\cite{Furnstahl:2012qg} for SRG-evolved potentials
	used an ansatz for which $\Delta E_d/E_d \propto \ee^{-b_1\Lambda_2^2}$
	(although $\Lambda_0$ instead of $\Lambda_2$ was
	actually used in~\cite{Furnstahl:2012qg}, this difference is not
	significant for the present discussion).  As we demonstrate in
	Sec.~\ref{subsec:gaussian}, this form works for a limited range in
	$\Lambda_2$ but is not generally applicable.

	  scale and without the separation factors.}
	\label{fig:deuteron_lambdas}
	\end{figure}
	%
	To develop a theoretical understanding of UV corrections, we first
	validate the claim that the error from oscillator basis truncation is
	well reproduced by applying instead a sharp cutoff in momentum at
	$\Lambda_2$.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:deuteron_vs_cutLam}, the calculations
	from Fig.~\ref{fig:UV_deuteron_HO}(b) are plotted as a function of
	$\Lambda = \Lambda_2(\Nmax,\Omega)$ along with several other functions
	of $\Lambda$ given by the relative error from the same Hamiltonian,
	but now smoothly cut off as
	%
	\begin{equation}
	H_{\rm cut}(k,k') = \ee^{-(k^2/\Lambda^2)^n} H(k,k')
	\ee^{-(k'{}^2/\Lambda^2)^n} \,,
	\end{equation}
	%
	for $n=2,4,8$ and $\infty$.  The latter corresponds to a sharp cutoff.
	We find that the curve from a sharp cutoff tracks the
	truncated-oscillator points through many orders of magnitude.  Finally,
	Fig.~\ref{fig:deuteron_lambdas} shows the relative error when plotted
	against three cutoff variables, $\Lambda_2$, $\Lambda_0$, and
	$\Lambda_{\kappa_{\rm max}}$.  The latter is defined as the square root
	of the largest eigenvalue of the squared momentum operator in the finite
	oscillator basis, which one might naively expect to be a natural choice.
	However, of the cases considered this actually gives the largest scatter
	in data.  From the fact that we get an essentially
	smooth curve  only for $\Lambda_2$, we conclude that this identification of
	the	relevant UV cutoff is correct.

	\subsection{Separable two-body interactions}
	\label{subsec:Separable_interactions}

	In this section we show that the UV error from oscillator basis
	truncations in the two-body problem can be determined exactly for any
	rank-one separable interaction by applying the effective
	sharp-momentum cutoff.  We demonstrate that unlike the case for IR
	corrections, the UV corrections depend on the high-momentum behavior
	of the potential.  We derive an explicit correction formula for
	separable potentials, and then adapt the approach to more general
	potentials, which leads to a practical fitting procedure.

	Let us consider two particles interacting via an S-wave ($\ell=0$) rank-one
	separable interaction of the form
	%
	\begin{equation}
	V(\veck,\veck') = V(k',k) = a\,\flam(k') \flam(k) \,.
	\label{eq:pot-RegContact}
	\end{equation}
	%
	While most of the following derivation is actually more general, we
	will consider below the case of non-negative, dimensionless regulator
	functions $\flam(k)$ that satisfy $\flam(0)=1$ and $\flam\to 0$ for
	$k/\lambda\to\infty$.  The potential~\eqref{eq:pot-RegContact} is then
	just a regularized contact interaction as it would arise, for example,
	from a low-energy effective theory (EFT), and the coupling constant
	$a$ is a length scale related (up to some rescaling factors) to an
	S-wave scattering length.  For convenience, in this section we work in
	units with $2\mu=1$, where $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the
	two-particle system.  We focus on the single bound state (assuming $a$
	is negative and large enough) with energy $\Einf \equiv -\kapinf^2$
	and momentum-space wavefunction $\phi(k)$.\footnote{$\phi(k)$ is the
  full three-dimensional wavefunction of the state, but it only
  depends on $k=|\veck|$ due to the S-wave nature of the state, and we
  have absorbed the constant factor $Y_{00}=1/\sqrt{4\pi}$ into the
  definition of $\phi$.}  Thus $\kappa_\infty$ is the binding
	momentum.  The Schr{\"o}dinger equation for $\phi(k)$ is
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 k^2 \phi(k) + a  \flam(k) \int\! \dd^3k'\, \flam(k')\phi(k')
	 = -\kappa_\infty^2 \phi(k) \,.
	\label{eq:haminfty}
	\end{equation}

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Exact extrapolation formula}

	Let us assume now that we are in a limited model space with an
	effective sharp momentum cutoff $\Lambda$.  In
	Sec.~\ref{subsec:UV_cutoff_duality}
	we have illustrated how this cutoff is related to the truncation
	parameter of a finite harmonic oscillator basis; below we will use a
	model interaction to further demonstrate the result
	$\Lambda=\Lambda_2$ numerically.

	Given $\Lambda$ and defining $\phi_\Lambda(k) \equiv
	\phi(k)\Theta(\Lambda-k)$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:haminfty} becomes
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 k^2\,\phi_\Lambda(k)
	 + a \,\flam(k)\,\Theta(\Lambda-k) \int\!\dd^3k'\,
	 \flam(k')\,\phi_\Lambda(k')
	 = -\kappa_\Lambda^2 \phi_\Lambda(k) \,.
	\label{eq:hamlambda}
  \end{equation}
	%
	Here, $\Theta$ denotes the unit step function, so $\Theta(\Lambda-k)$ is a
	projector, and Eq.~\eqref{eq:hamlambda} is obtained by simply introducing
	such
	a projector for each momentum dependence.  To indicate the cutoff dependence
	of the energy eigenvalue, we now write it as $-\kappa_\Lambda^2$.  Note that
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:hamlambda} turns into Eq.~\eqref{eq:haminfty} for
	$\Lambda\to\infty$.  We solve Eq.~\eqref{eq:hamlambda} for $\phi_\Lambda(k)$
	and find (for $k < \Lambda$)
	%
	\begin{equation}
	\phi_\Lambda(k) = \frac{c_\Lambda \flam(k)}{\kappa^2_\Lambda +k^2} \,,
	\label{eq:phi}
	\end{equation}
	%
	where
	%
	\begin{equation}
	c_\Lambda \equiv -a \int\! \dd^3k\, \flam(k)\,\phi_\Lambda(k)
	\label{eq:cLambda}
	\end{equation}
	%
	is independent of $k$.  Thus, we know the full momentum dependence of
	$\phi_\Lambda$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:phi}.  The cutoff does not imply
	that $\phi_\Lambda(k)$ goes smoothly to zero at $k=\Lambda$, unlike
	the behavior of a coordinate-space wavefunction with a hard-wall
	boundary condition, because the momentum-space potential is nonlocal.

	For the determination of the eigenvalue $\kappa_\Lambda$ we insert the
	solution~\eqref{eq:phi} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:hamlambda}---or just
	substitute~\eqref{eq:phi} into~\eqref{eq:cLambda} and cancel the common
	factor $c_\Lambda$---to find the quantization condition
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 {-}1 = a \int\! \dd^3k\,
	 \frac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(\Lambda-k)}{\kappa^2_\Lambda+k^2}
	 = 4\pi a \int_0^\Lambda\!\dd k\,
	 \frac{k^2\,f^2_\lambda(k)}{\kappa^2_\Lambda+k^2}
	 \,,
	\label{eq:quant}
	\end{equation}
	%
	which is straightforward to solve numerically.  Note that
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant} implies that there is at most one bound state,
	as we have assumed.  Note also that the quantized solution
	$\kappa^2_\Lambda$ \emph{increases} to $\kapinf^2$ as $\Lambda$
	approaches $\infty$.

	To derive an analytic formula for the dependence of $\kappa_\Lambda$
	on $\Lambda$, we start by defining (recall that we set $\hbar=2\mu=1$)
	%
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta E_{\Lambda} \equiv E_\Lambda - \Einf =
	\kapinf^2 - \kappa_\Lambda^2 \,.
	\end{equation}
	%
	Inserting this into Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant} and Taylor-expanding to first order
	in $\Delta E_{\Lambda}/\kappa_\infty^2$, we find
	%
	\begin{align}
	 -1 &= a \int\! \dd^3k\,
	 \frac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(\Lambda-k)}
	 {\kappa^2_\infty+k^2-\Delta E_{\Lambda}} \nonumber \\
	 &\approx
	 a\int\! \dd^3 k\,
	 \frac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(\Lambda-k)}{\kappa^2_\infty+k^2}
	 \left(1+{\frac{\Delta E_{\Lambda}}{\kappa_\infty^2+k^2}}\right)
	 \nonumber \\
	 &= -1 - a \int\! \dd^3k\,
	 \frac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(k-\Lambda)}{\kappa^2_\infty+k^2}
	 + \Delta E_{\Lambda} \, a\int\! \dd^3k\,
	 \frac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(\Lambda-k)}{(\kappa^2_\infty+k^2)^2} \,.
	\end{align}
	%
	In the second step here we have employed Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant} for
	$\Lambda=\infty$, also using $\Theta(\Lambda-k) = 1 - \Theta(k-\Lambda)$.
	Thus, the general result for $\Delta E_{\Lambda}$ is
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \Delta E_{\Lambda} \approx
	 \dfrac{\displaystyle\int\!\dd^3 k\,
	     \dfrac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(k-\Lambda)}{\kapinf^2 + k^2}
	 }
	 {\displaystyle\int\!\dd^3 k\,
	     \dfrac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(\Lambda-k)}{(\kappa^2_\infty+k^2)^2}} \,.
	\label{eq:deltaE}
	\end{equation}
	%
	This should be a quantitatively accurate expression in those regions
	of $\Lambda$ for which $\Delta E_{\Lambda} \le \kappa_\infty^2$.

	We can further approximate the result by dropping terms of
	$\mathcal{O}(\kapinf^2/\Lambda^2)$, noting that this may not be a good
	quantitative approximation when $\Lambda \approx \lambda$:
	%
	\begin{eqnarray}
	 \Delta E_{\Lambda} &=&
	 \dfrac{\displaystyle\int\!\dd^3 k\,
	   \dfrac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(k-\Lambda)}{k^2}}
	 {\displaystyle\int\! \dd^3 k\,
	   \dfrac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(\Lambda-k)}{(\kappa^2_\infty+k^2)^2}}
	   \Big[1+ {\mathcal O}(\kappa_\infty^2/\Lambda^2)\Big]
	   \nonumber\\
	 &\approx&
	   \dfrac{\displaystyle\int\!\dd^3 k\,
	     \dfrac{f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(k-\Lambda)}{k^2}}
	 {\displaystyle\int\!\dd^3 k\,
	    \dfrac{f^2_\lambda(k)}{(\kappa^2_\infty+k^2)^2}}
	    \Big[1+ {\mathcal O}(\kappa_\infty^2/\Lambda^2)\Big]
	 \,.
	\label{eq:deltaEapprox}
	\end{eqnarray}
	%
	In the last step, we extended the integration in the denominator from
	$\Lambda$ to $\infty$.  This introduces a negligible error for
	reasonable regulators when $\Lambda \gg \lambda$.  However, we may
	want to keep the $\Lambda$-dependence in the denominator more general.

	If we make all these approximations, then the $\Lambda$-dependence of
	$\Delta E_{\Lambda}$ is simple, and we have
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \Delta E_{\Lambda} \propto \int\!\dd k\, f^2_\lambda(k)\Theta(k-\Lambda)
	 = \int\limits_\Lambda^\infty \dd k\, f^2_\lambda(k) \,.
	\label{eq:final}
	\end{equation}
	%
	Thus, the cutoff dependence is determined entirely by the regulator,
	while the low-energy length scale $a$ has dropped out in this
	approximation and only appears in weaker approximations through
	$\kapinf$.  In other words, the energy correction will depend strongly
	on the details of how the potential falls off at large momentum, but
	only weakly on the strength of the potential.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Perturbation theory}

	Here we show that the result~\eqref{eq:deltaEapprox} for $\Delta
	E_{\Lambda}$ in the region $\Lambda > \lambda$ can also be derived
	from first-order perturbation theory.  The unperturbed wavefunction is
	from Eq.~\eqref{eq:phi} with $\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$:
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \phiinf(k) \equiv \langle k | \phiinf \rangle
	 = \frac{\cinf \flam(k)}{\kapinf^2+k^2}
	 \,,
	\label{eq:phiunperturb}
	\end{equation}
	%
	and the perturbation can be written  (for S-waves) as
	%
	\begin{multline}
	 \delta H(k,k') =
	    -\Big[
	     k^2 \frac{\delta(k-k')}{4\pi kk'} \Theta(k-\Lambda) \Theta(k'-\Lambda) \\
	     + a\,\flam(k')\flam(k) \big[\Theta(k-\Lambda) + \Theta(k'-\Lambda)\big]
	    \Big] \,.
	\label{eq:sepperturbation}
	\end{multline}
	%
	In writing $\delta H(k,k')$, we have
	neglected a contribution to the second term proportional to $\Theta(k-\Lambda)
	\Theta(k'-\Lambda)$, which would be doubly suppressed by $\flam(k>\Lambda)$.

	The first-order energy shift is
	%
	\begin{eqnarray}
	 \Delta\ELam
	 &=& \frac{\langle\phiinf|\delta H | \phiinf\rangle}
	   {\langle\phiinf|\phiinf\rangle}
	 \nonumber \\ [0.8em]
	 &=& -\biggl[
	  4\pi \cinf^2 \int_\Lambda^\infty\! \dd k\, k^2 \frac{k^2\flam^2(k)}
	  {(\kapinf^2 + k^2)^2}
	  + (2a)4\pi \cinf \int_0^\infty\! \dd k'\, k'^{2}
	  \flam(k')\frac{\flam(k')}{\kapinf^2 + k'{}^2}
	  \nonumber \\
	  & &\qquad\null
	  \times 4\pi\cinf \int_\Lambda^\infty\! \dd k\, k^2 \flam(k)\frac{\flam(k)}
	  {\kapinf^2 + k^2}
	 \biggr]
	 \left[4\pi \cinf^2\int_{0}^{\infty}\! \dd k\, k^2
	  \frac{\flam^2(k)}{(\kapinf^2 + k^2)^2} \right]^{-1}
	 \nonumber \\ [0.8em]
	 &=& -\left[
	  \int_\Lambda^\infty\! \dd k\, \frac{k^4\flam^2(k)}{(\kapinf^2 + k^2)^2}
	   - 2 \int_\Lambda^\infty\! \dd k\,  \frac{k^2\flam^2(k)}{\kapinf^2 + k^2}
	   \right]
	   \left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\! \dd k\,
	   \frac{k^2 \flam^2(k)}{(\kapinf^2 + k^2)^2} \right]^{-1}
	 \nonumber \\ [0.8em]
	 &=& \left[
	     \int_\Lambda^\infty\! \dd k\, \flam^2(k)
	   \right]
	   \times \left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\! \dd k\, \frac{k^2 \flam^2(k)}
	   {(\kapinf^2 + k^2)^2} \right]^{-1}
	  \Big[1+ {\mathcal O}(\kapinf^2/\Lambda^2)\Big] \,.
	\end{eqnarray}
	%
	This agrees with Eq.~\eqref{eq:deltaEapprox} up to terms of order
	$\kapinf^2/\Lambda^2$.
	Note that an analogous application of first-order perturbation theory
	fails if applied to the IR correction; one finds the leading
	$\ee^{-2\kinf L}$ dependence is found, but with the wrong coefficient.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Asymptotic expansion}

	It is instructive to look at the large $\Lambda$ expansion of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:final} when $\flam(k)$ has the form of a Gaussian or
	super-Gaussian:
	%
	\begin{equation}
	  f_\lambda(k) = \ee^{-(k/\lambda)^{2n}}
	  \;.
	\end{equation}
	%
	We can express $\varepsilon$ in this case in terms of the incomplete
	gamma function $\Gamma(a,z)$~\cite{Olver:2010:NHMF}:
	%
	\begin{eqnarray}
	  \Delta\ELam &\propto& \int_{\Lambda}^{\infty}\! \dd
	k\,\ee^{-2(k/\lambda)^{2n}}
	     \nonumber \\
	  &=& \frac{\lambda}{4n}\int_{2(\Lambda/\lambda)^{2n}}^\infty \! \dd t\,
	     (t/2)^{\frac{1}{2n} - 1} \ee^{-t}
	     \nonumber \\
	  &=& \frac{\lambda}{4n}\frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{2n} - 1}}
	  \Gamma\!\left(\frac{1}{2n},2(\Lambda/\lambda)^{2n}\right)
	  \;,
	\end{eqnarray}
	%
	so that for $\Lambda \gg \lambda$,
	%
	\begin{equation}
	  \varepsilon(\Lambda) \underset{\Lambda\gg\lambda}{\longrightarrow}
	   [\mbox{const.}] \times \lambda
	   \left(\frac{\Lambda}{\lambda}\right)^{1-2n} \ee^{-2(\Lambda/\lambda)^{2n}}
	   \;.
	\end{equation}
	%
	Only for $n=1$ does this have the Gaussian form used in
	phenomenological methods for extrapolation, which is further
	verification of the non-universality of UV corrections.  However, the
	asymptotic region where $\Lambda \gg \lambda$ is seldom reached in
	practice (if it were, convergence would likely be sufficient without
	extrapolation).  When $\Lambda$ is the same size or smaller than
	$\lambda$, and if the region over which a fit is made is limited, then a
	Gaussian form can arise, as shown in Sec.~\ref{subsec:gaussian}.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Numerical calculations}

	We test the extrapolation law~\eqref{eq:final} with the specific but
	arbitrary choice
	%
	\begin{equation}
	\flam(k) = \ee^{-\left({k/\lambda}\right)^4} \,,
	\label{eq:regul-f4}
	\end{equation}
	%
	with $\lambda=2.0$~fm$^{-1}$ and $a=-0.1$~fm.  The solution of the
	quantization condition~\eqref{eq:quant} yields $\kappa_\infty\approx
	0.634$~fm$^{-1}$.
	%
	\begin{figure}[tbh-]
	 \centering
	 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
	 {Extrapolation/SimpleContactFit}
	 \caption{Test of the extrapolation law~\eqref{eq:final} for a
	   contact $a=-0.1$~fm and quartic regulator~\eqref{eq:regul-f4} with
	   $\lambda=2$~fm.  Points: solution of the quantization
	   condition~\eqref{eq:quant}.  Line: Fit of $\kappa_\infty$ and $A$ from
	   Eq.~\eqref{eq:fit}.
	 }
	\label{fig:SimpleContactFit}
	\end{figure}
	%
	Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleContactFit} shows the numerical solution of the
	exact quantization condition~\eqref{eq:quant} plotted as
	$\kappa_\Lambda$ {\it vs.} $\Lambda$ (circles).  The line is the
	extrapolation with the function~\eqref{eq:final}, \ie, we write
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \Delta\ELam = \kappa_\Lambda^2 - \kappa_\infty^2
	 \approx 2\kappa_\infty \Delta\kappa_\Lambda
	 \mathtext{with}
	 \Delta\kappa_\Lambda = \kappa_\infty - \kappa_\Lambda
	\label{eq:kappaEps}
	\end{equation}
	%
	and determine $\kappa_\infty$ and the proportionality constant $A$ from a
	fit to
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \kappa_\Lambda
	 = \kappa_\infty - \Delta\kappa
	 = \kappa_\infty - A \int_\Lambda^\infty \dd k\,f^2_\lambda(k) \,.
	\label{eq:fit}
	\end{equation}
	%
	Note that $\kappa_\infty\ll\Lambda$, and $\Lambda>\lambda$, as
	required.  Despite the approximations, the fit is very good, and in
	fact the extracted value for $A$ agrees to better than 10\% with the
	explicit result
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 A_\infty = \left
	 (2\kappa_\infty
	 \times \int_0^\infty\!\dd k\,k^2 \frac{\flam(k)^2}
	 {(\kappa_\infty^2+k^2)^2} \right)^{\!-1} \,,
	\end{equation}
	%
	which follows directly from combining Eqs.~\eqref{eq:deltaEapprox}
	and~\eqref{eq:kappaEps}.
	This simple test already suggests that the approximations in deriving
	the extrapolation law~\eqref{eq:final} are well under control.
	%
	\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	 \centering
	 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
	 {Extrapolation/OscContactFit-f4}
	 \caption{Oscillator calculations (with $b=2.5$~fm and
	   $n=6,\ldots,16$) and extrapolations a contact $a=-0.1$~fm and

	   Circles and short-dashed line: direct-quantization result and fit, same as

	 }
	\label{fig:OscContactFit-f4}
	\end{figure}
	%
	Indeed, the extrapolation also works very well for calculations in
	truncated oscillator bases, provided the effective UV cutoff is
	calculated according to $\Lambda=\Lambda_2$ as derived in
	Subsec.~\ref{subsec:UV_cutoff_duality}.  Although the overall cutoff
	dependence is	quite small for the simple regularized contact interaction,
	one can	clearly see a substantial improvement when one uses
	$\Lambda=\Lambda_2$ instead of the naive estimate $\Lambda=\Lambda_0$.
	As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:OscContactFit-f4}, the difference between
	the two choices is a horizontal shift of the oscillator data that
	moves them almost right on top of the direct-quantization result
	according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant}.  If instead of
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:regul-f4} we use a Gaussian regulator,
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \flam(k) = \ee^{-\left({k/\lambda}\right)^2} \,,
	\label{eq:regul-f2}
	\end{equation}
	%
	the overall cutoff dependence is somewhat stronger, but, as shown in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:OscContactFit-f2}, the qualitative behavior is exactly
	the same.  In fact, the agreement is even somewhat better, at least
	for the parameters chosen in the calculation.
	%

	   Symbols and curves are as in Fig.~\ref{fig:OscContactFit-f4}.}
	\label{fig:OscContactFit-f2}
	\end{figure}
	%

	To get a more quantitative assessment of the agreement, in
	Figs.~\ref{fig:ContactErrorPlot-f4} and~\ref{fig:ContactErrorPlot-f2}
	we plot the quantity
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \Delta\kappa_\Lambda = |\kappa(m) - \kappa_{\Lambda(m)}|
	\label{eq:Delta-kappa}
	\end{equation}
	%
	on a logarithmic scale for different choices of $\Lambda_m$.  With this
	notation we mean that for a given truncation parameter $m$ we first calculate
	the corresponding effective cutoff $\Lambda_m$ and then apply
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant} to obtain the exact binding momentum for that cutoff.
	In these calculations we have used a very large oscillator length $b=6.0$~fm to
	suppress IR corrections and go up to very large truncation parameters
	(up to $n=72$) to still reach sizable UV cutoffs.  For both regulators
	discussed above (quartic and Gaussian), the $\Lambda=\Lambda_2$ curve clearly
	lies below the one for $\Lambda=\Lambda_0$.

	In these plots we have also included the result with the first
	subleading correction to $\Lambda=\Lambda_2$ (see
	Appendix~\ref{subsec:appendix_subleading}).  It is reassuring to see that
	there is some	small improvement (the curves for $\Lambda=\Lambda_2^{(1)}$ lie
	consistently below those for $\Lambda=\Lambda_2$), but we conclude that these
	corrections can	safely be neglected for all present practical purposes.

	\subsection{Separable approximations and tests on model potentials}
	\label{subsec:Separable_approximation}

	For a general rank-1 separable potential
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \hat{V}_\text{sep} = g \, \ket{\eta}\bra{\eta} \,,
	\end{equation}
	%
	which in momentum space simply becomes (with $\eta(k)\equiv\braket{k}{\eta}$)
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 V_\text{sep}(k,k') = g \, \eta(k)\eta(k') \,,
	\end{equation}
	%
	the quantization condition~\eqref{eq:quant} can be written as
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 -1 = 4\pi g
	 \int_0^\Lambda\!\dd k\, k^2 \frac{\eta(k)^2}{\kappa^2_\Lambda+k^2} \,.
	\label{eq:quant-sep}
	\end{equation}
	%
	This is, of course, merely a change of notation, $a \rightarrow g$ and
	$\flam(k)\rightarrow\eta(k)$ compared to Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant}.  Most
	interactions used in practical calculations, however, do not have this
	convenient simple form (at least not in nuclear physics).  Still,
	Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant-sep} can be put to some use.

	Methods to obtain separable approximations for a given potential have
	been known and used for quite a while (see, \eg,
	Refs.~\cite{Harms:1970hd,Ernst:1973zzb,elgaroy1998} and further references
	therein).  We use the technique here in its simplest form, also called
	the \emph{unitary pole approximation
	(UPA)}~\cite{Ernst:1973zzb,Lovelace:1964aa}.  Assuming that for an
	arbitrary potential $\hat{V}$ we know a (bound) eigenstate $\ket{\psi}$, we
	can	construct a rank-1 separable approximation in momentum space by setting
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \hat{V}_\text{sep} = \frac{\hat{V}\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}\hat{V}}
	 {\mbraket{\psi}{\hat{V}}{\psi}} \,.
	\label{eq:UPA-op}
	\end{equation}
	%
	In other words, we have
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \eta(k) = \mbraket{k}{\hat{V}}{\psi}
	\end{equation}
	%
	for the momentum-space ``form factor,'' and the coupling strength
	$g=\mbraket{\psi}{\hat{V}}{\psi}$ is, of course, independent of any
	particular representation.  From Eq.~\eqref{eq:UPA-op} one immediately sees
	that
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \hat{V}_\text{sep}\ket{\psi} = \hat{V}\ket{\psi} \,.
	\label{eq:Vsep-psi-V-psi}
	\end{equation}
	%
	This means that the separable approximation is constructed in such a
	way that it exactly reproduces the state $\ket{\psi}$ used for its
	construction.  The potential~\eqref{eq:UPA-op} reproduces the exact
	half off-shell T-matrix at the energy corresponding to the state
	$\psi$, and more sophisticated approximations (separable potential of
	rank $>1$) can be constructed by using more than a single
	state~\cite{Ernst:1973zzb}.  Since we are only interested in
	performing the UV extrapolation for a single state here, however, the
	rank-1 approximation should be sufficient.  In fact, based on our
	expectation that the UV extrapolation we seek should depend on
	short-range/high-momentum modes of the potential and the state under
	consideration, Eq.~\eqref{eq:UPA-op} looks very promising.  To assess
	to what extent it actually reflects the UV behavior of a calculation
	based on the \emph{original} potential, we first consider some
	examples where the separable approximation can be constructed
	analytically.

	\medskip
	\subsubsection{Spherical Well}

	One of the simplest potentials for which the
	bound-state wavefunctions can be written down explicitly in closed form is
	the	spherical well (step),
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \Vstep(r) = V_0\,\Theta(R - r) \mathtext{,} V_0 < 0 \,.
	\label{eq:V-step}
	\end{equation}
	%
	The eigenfunctions for this standard textbook example are spherical Bessel
	functions.  Separable approximations for these potential have been discussed
	in Ref.~\cite{Bund:1980aa}.  If $\Vstep$ supports an S-wave bound-state at
	energy $E=-\kappa^2$, we find from the results presented there that

	In Fig.~\ref{fig:SepCompare-SW} we show how the separable
	approximation~\eqref{eq:eta-step} (squares) performs compared to the original
	potential~\eqref{eq:V-step} (circles) in an oscillator calculation.  We use
	$V_0=-4~\fm^{-1}$ and $R=1~\fm$, which produces a bound state at
	$\kappa_\infty\approx0.638~\fm^{-1}$ (determined numerically from the
	quantization condition for attractive step potentials and shown as the
	dotted line in Fig.~\ref{fig:SepCompare-SW}).  The dashed line furthermore
	shows the result of a direct calculation based on Eqs.~\eqref{eq:quant-sep}
	and~\eqref{eq:eta-step} (see inset).

	The results of all three calculations agree remarkably well.  The fact that
	the separable approximation used in the oscillator calculations follows the
	result from the direct quantization according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:quant-sep} is
	primarily reassuring.  More interestingly, the latter also traces the result
	of a ``full''
	oscillator calculation based on the original step potential---including the
	rather slow convergence towards the exact result and even the peculiar step
	around $\Lambda\approx6~\fm^{-1}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:SepCompare-SW}.

	These features are due to the rather pathological (oscillatory)
	behavior of the step potential in momentum space.  In the next subsection, we
	avoid this complication by studying another class of exactly solvable
	interactions, which are smooth.

	\subsubsection{P\"{o}schl-Teller potential}

	It is convenient for us to consider a
	so-called P\"{o}schl--Teller potential of the form
	%
	\begin{equation}
	 \VPT(r) = -\frac{\alpha^2 \beta(\beta-1)}{\cosh^2(\alpha r)}
	\label{eq:V-PT}
	\end{equation}
	%
	Originally, this potential describes a one-dimensional problem on the interval
	$(-\infty,\infty)$.  However, restricting ourselves to S-waves (and to
	states with odd wavefunctions), we can use it as a solvable problem in
	three dimensions.  For given values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, this potential has
	an analytically known bound-state spectrum.  Labeling different states by an
	index $\nu$, we have, for example, a single bound state ($\nu=0$) with binding
	momentum $\kappa=\alpha$ for $\beta=3$.  For $\beta=5$, there are two bound
	states at $\kappa=3\alpha$ ($\nu=0$) and $\kappa=\alpha$ ($\nu=1$).  The
	wavefunctions for this potentials are known analytically as well, which allows
	us to derive explicit expressions for the form factors $\eta(k)$ as well.
	These details are given in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_PT-Details}.

	In Fig.~\ref{fig:SepCompare-PT} we show results for a P\"{o}schl--Teller
	potential
	with $\beta=3$ and a bound-state at $\kappa=\alpha=2/3~\fmi$.  The curves are
	analogous to those shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SepCompare-SW} for the step
	potential.  While the agreement of the calculations with the original
	potential and with the separable approximation is not as impressive as for the
	step potential, it is still very good for cutoffs $\Lambda_2\gsim2.5~\fm^{-1}$
	($n>8$).

	In general, the regime where UV cutoff effects dominate the energy
	correction can be found from plots like the one shown in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:bDep-PT3-23}, where we plot the $b$-dependence of
	$\kappa$ for our P{\"o}schl--Teller potential with $\beta=3$ and
	$\alpha=2/3~\fm$.  Recalling that large $b$ correspond to large
	configuration-space boxes $L_2 = \sqrt{2(2n+3/2+2)}b$ and thus
	negligible IR correction, we identify the UV-dominated region as the
	one with $b\gsim2$.
