\chapter{Factorization}

	\section{Motivation}

	Most of the information we know about nuclear interactions and the properties
	of the nuclei comes from some kind of scattering experiments (either elastic
	or inelastic).  In such experiments we scatter a known probe off a nucleus
	and	extract information about nuclear interactions by looking at the final
	outcome of the scattering experiment.

	%
	Figure~\ref{fig:knock_out_schematic} shows a schematic for a nucleon knockout
	reaction where the probe is electrons which in turn interact with the nucleus
	by emitting virtual photons.

	The process of extracting nuclear properties from such experiments relies
	on the assumption that the effects of the probe are well understood and can
	be separated from the nuclear interactions we are trying to study.  This is
	the	\emph{factorization} between the nuclear structure and the nuclear
	reaction components illustrated schematically in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:factorization_schematic}.  The reaction component describes the
	probe and the structure includes description of the initial and final states.
	This factorization between the structure and reaction components depends
	on the renormalization scale and scheme.  In some physical systems
	(e.g., in cold atoms near unitarity~\cite{Hoinka:2013fsa}), the scale and
	scheme dependence is very weak and can be safely neglected.  In some other
	physical system such as in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in high-energy
	QCD, the scale and scheme dependence is very manifest.

	\end{figure}
	%
	Figure~\ref{fig:factorization_schematic_highE_QCD} illustrates the
	factorization in DIS.  The form factor $F_2$ of the nucleon
	(which up to some kinematic factors is the cross section) is given by the
	convolution of the long-distance parton density and the short-distance
	Wilson coefficient.  In this case, the parton density forms the structure
	part which is non-perturbative and the Wilson coefficient form the reactions
	part which can be calculated in perturbative QCD.  These separation
	between long- and short-distance physics is not unique, and is defined by
	the factorization scale $\mu_f$.  To minimize the contribution of logarithms
	that can disturb the perturbative expansion, $\mu_f$ is chosen to be equal to
	the	magnitude of the four-momentum transfer $Q$.
	The form factor $F_2$ (because it is
	related to the observable cross section) is independent of $\mu_f$, but
	the individual components are not.  As a consequence, the parton density
	(or distribution) function $f_a(x, Q^2)$ runs with $Q^2$.

	\label{fig:uquark_PDF_3D}
	\end{figure}
	%
	This is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:uquark_PDF_3D}.  The parton
	distributions
	$f_a(x, Q^2)$ and $f_a(x, Q_0^2)$	at two different $Q^2$ are related by
	DGLAP evolution or the Altarelli-Parisi equations \cite{Altarelli:1977zs}.
	Thus the scale dependence of the structure and reaction components is well
	understood in high-energy QCD.

	The situation is far from well settled in low-energy nuclear physics.
	Nuclear
	structure has conventionally been treated largely separate from nuclear
	reactions
	(e.g., the two volumes of Feshbach's \emph{Theoretical Nuclear Physics} are
	divided
	this way).  The nuclear structure community usually dealt with calculating
	time-independent properties such as nuclear binding energies, excitation
	spectra, radii, so on whereas the nuclear reaction experts worked on
	disintegration,	knock-out and
	transfer reactions.  However, both the communities invariably use inputs
	from the other side, and the consistency and universality of different
	components is not
	always guaranteed. 	To go back to the high-energy QCD analogy, the parton
	distribution functions (PDFs) $f_a(x, Q)$ extracted from the DIS are
	universal, in	the sense that they are process-independent.  For instance,
	the PDFs extracted
	from the DIS can be used for making prediction for the Drell-Yan process.
	The analogous process independence in the extracted quantities has not yet
	been achieved in low-energy nuclear physics.  This leads to ambiguous
	uncertainty	quantification when the nuclear properties extracted from one
	process	(cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:factorization_schematic}) are used as an input to
	predict something	else.

	The factorization in low-energy nuclear physics is illustrated in
	Fig.~\ref{fig:low_energy_factorization}.

	\label{fig:low_energy_factorization}
	\end{figure}
	%
	The observable cross section in this case is a convolution of the
	spectroscopic factor
	and single-particle cross section.  However, there are many open questions
	such as	what are the nuclear properties that we can extract and what is the
	scale/scheme dependence of the extracted properties.

	The Similarity Renormalization Group (or the SRG) transformations were
	introduced in	Subsec.~\ref{subsec:SRG_intro}.  We noted that SRG
	transformations are a class of unitary transformations that soften nuclear
	Hamiltonians and lead to accelerated convergence of observables.

	\label{fig:momentum_distribution}
	\end{figure}
	%
	Figure~\ref{fig:momentum_distribution} shows the momentum distribution for
	the deuteron as a function of the SRG scale and momentum.  Note that
	Fig.~\ref{fig:momentum_distribution} is analogous to
	Fig.~\ref{fig:uquark_PDF_3D}.  The SRG evolution gets rid of the
	high-momentum components and therefore the evolved momentum distributions
	don't have the short-range correlations (SRCs).
	Figure~\ref{fig:momentum_distribution} makes it clear that the
	high-momentum tail of the momentum distribution is dramatically resolution
	dependent.  Yet it is common in the literature that
	high-momentum components are treated as measurable, at least
	implicitly~\cite{Frankfurt:2008zv,Arrington:2011xs,Rios:2013zqa,
	Boeglin:2015cha}.
	In fact, what can be extracted is the momentum distribution at some scale,
	and	with the specification of a scheme.  This makes momentum distributions
	model	dependent~\cite{Ford:2014yua, Sammarruca:2015hba}.

	%
	Figure~\ref{fig:wavefunction_evolution_deuteron_D_state} shows the $D$-state
	wave function for deuteron.  We see that just like the momentum distributions,
	SRG transformed wave functions do not have the high-momentum components.
	Therefore,
	if we use the SRG evolved wave function for calculating cross section for a
	process involving high-momentum probe, then the only way we get the same
	answer as with the unevolved wave function is if the relevant operator
	changed as well.  Thus, with SRG evolution, the high-momentum physics is
	shuffled from the wave function (nuclear structure) to the operator
	(nuclear reaction component).  This is reminiscent of chiral EFTs where the
	renormalization replaces the high-momentum modes in intermediate states
	by contact interactions (see Fig.~\ref{fig:replace_loop_contact}).

	Discussion so far shows how SRG makes the scale dependence of factorization
	explicit.  SRG transformations come with the momentum scale $\lambda$ and

	%
	this sets the scale for factorization.  As seen in the
	Fig.~\ref{fig:SRG_factorization}, we have a natural separation that the piece
	which involves momenta less than $\lambda$ forms the long-distance part and
	the piece that involves momenta greater than $\lambda$ forms the
	short-distance part.

	Consider the differential cross section given by the overlap matrix element
	of initial and final states.
	\beq
	\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega} \propto \left|
	\mbraket{\psi_f}{\widehat{O}}{\psi_i} \right|^2 \;.
	\eeq
	The SRG evolved wave function is given by $\ket{\psi_i^\lambda} =
	U_{\lambda} \ket{\psi_i}$, where $U_{\lambda}$ is the unitary matrix
	associated with the SRG transformation.
